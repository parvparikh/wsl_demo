			"Penguins are social animals. They live in groups above the water from which they\n",
			"get \ufb01sh for food. Unfortunately, there is more than \ufb01sh in the water. From time to\n",
			"time, killer whales (orcas) roam under the surface waiting for some prey. Penguins are\n",
			"aware of the danger and would like to have some information before taking a plunge.\n",
			"Indeed, any sensible penguin thinks that it would be very nice if some other penguin\n",
			"would dive \ufb01rst to test the water. So what is a penguin to do? Wait. Possibly some\n",
			"other member of the colony who is more hungry, or has other information, will go\n",
			"\ufb01rst. Is it possible that no penguin will ever go? No, because waiting becomes more\n",
			"costly as hunger increases. Eventually, one or more penguins will take the plunge,\n",
			"and, depending on the outcome, the others will either stay put or follow en masse.\n",
			"This waiting game is socially inef\ufb01cient. It would be better if the \ufb01rst individual would\n",
			"decide to go at least a bit earlier: the \ufb01rst to go is, on the margin, as well off going just\n",
			"a little earlier; but others strictly prefer him to go a little earlier. Actually, the penguins\n",
			"are well aware of this social inef\ufb01ciency, which they try to remedy by pushing some\n",
			"poor fellow off the cliff.\n",

			"First-Cousin Marriages\n",
			"There is a long-standing taboo against marriages between \ufb01rst cousins in some parts\n",
			"of the world. Such taboos may entail signi\ufb01cant costs. In the United States, about\n",
			"thirty states have laws forbidding \ufb01rst cousins to marry, but on some other continents\n",
			"marriages between cousins are well regarded. Recent, and remarkably late, evidence\n",
			"shows that the risk of defects for children is marginally higher in such marriages than\n",
			"in the general population (Motulsky et al., 2002):\n",
			"\n",
			"Dr. Motulsky said that medical geneticists had known for a long time that there was\n",
			"little or no harm in cousins\u2019 marrying and having children. \u2018Somehow, this hasn\u2019t\n",
			"become general knowledge,\u2019 Dr. Motulsky said. \u2018Among the public and physicians\n",
			"there\u2019s a feeling it\u2019s real bad and brings a lot of disease, and there\u2019s a lot of social\n",
			"and legal disapproval.\u2019 Dr. Motulsky said the American laws against cousin marriage\n",
			"should be abolished, because they are based in part on the mistaken belief that the\n",
			"children of such parents will suffer from terrible physical and mental illnesses.1\n",

			"The White-Van Frenzy\n",
			"On October 26, 2002, one could read this in the New York Times:\n",
			"\n",
			"Until the \ufb01nal moments of the three-week reign of sniper terror in the Washing-\n",
			"ton area, there was one image, one all-consuming clue, seared into the minds of a\n",
			"panicked public: the white van.\n",
			"\n",
			"White vans were pictured on wanted posters everywhere. Their drivers were\n",
			"stopped four, \ufb01ve, six times a day. They were forsaken by some, who rented or\n",
			"borrowed other vehicles because they simply could not take it anymore: the constant\n",
			"traf\ufb01c stops, the swooping in of gun-wielding police of\ufb01cers, the stares from other\n",
			"drivers and pedestrians, the snooping around their license plates and sneaky peeks\n",
			"into their rear windows to check for ri\ufb02es and other signs of sniping. Each shooting\n",
			"and each day that passed without an arrest brought a new \ufb02ood of tips and witness\n",
			"accounts involving white vans and trucks, seemingly fed by the earliest witness\n",
			"accounts.\n",
			"\n",
			"Witnesses to some of the \ufb01rst shootings were able to describe only a glimpse at\n",
			"a \ufb02eeing white vehicle, information that the police quickly released and eventually\n",
			"used to put together composite sketches. So there was nothing but a white van and\n",
			"before that, a white box truck to look for. With no description of the killer, many\n",
			"people, gripped with fear of another attack and seizing on any detail in their personal\n",
			"lookout for the sniper, were in a kind of white-van haze. [. . .]\n",
			"\n",
			"For a time, the police themselves were so focused on white vans and trucks \u2013\n",
			"there are roughly 100,000 on the roads of Washington and its suburbs \u2013 that they may\n",
			"have overlooked the vehicle they really needed to \ufb01nd. In fact, of\ufb01cers in Washington\n",
			"stopped the blue Caprice, ran a check on its license plates and then allowed the two\n",
			"men to proceed only a couple of hours before one of the sniper killings. [. . .]\n",
			"\n",
			"\u201cDarn right I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over,\u201d said Sinclair Skinner, who drives a white van for\n",
			"his dry-cleaning delivery service but parked it two weeks ago after being stopped\n",
			"by the police twice in one day, and rented a car. \u201cThe police were stopping people,\n",
			"people were asking me all kinds of questions. Finally I said: \u2018Look, I\u2019m not involved\n",
			"in anything. I\u2019m not the Taliban. I wasn\u2019t in the gulf war. I\u2019m a paci\ufb01st. I listen to\n",
			"Paci\ufb01ca Radio.\u2019 \u201d [. . .]\n",
			"\n",
			"Meanwhile, the police, including all 1,000 of\ufb01cers on the Montgomery County\n",
			"force, the lead agency in the investigation, combed the area for white vans. When a\n",
			"van was stopped, several police cars often surrounded it, and of\ufb01cers drew their guns,\n",
			"sometimes telling the drivers to come out with their hands up and then ordering\n",
			"them to lie face down on the ground.\n",
			"\n",
			"The white van, said Of\ufb01cer Baliles, \u201cwas the best lookout we had.\u201d\n",
			"\n",
			"Umbrellas\n",
			"The actions of others convey some information about the state of the world. When\n",
			"I see other people going out with an umbrella, I take an umbrella along without\n",
			"checking the weather forecast. I do so because I know the decision model of others. I\n",
			"can then infer their private information from their action without the need to talk to\n",
			"them. This herding is rational. There is, however, the possibility that everyone carries\n",
			"an umbrella because someone carries an umbrella. The herd may be wrong.\n",

			"The learning from others can operate through different channels of information\n",
			"(choices or results of actions, words), and in different contexts (with or without delay\n",
			"between actions, real or \ufb01nancial investment) and may be affected by externalities\n",
			"between the actions. The chapters are designed to study one issue at a time.\n",
			"\n",
			"PART I: SOCIAL LEARNING\n",
			"\n",
			"The Tools\n",
			"All models will have a key random variable, which will not be observed directly: the\n",
			"state of nature. The state of nature may be the pro\ufb01tability of a set of new techniques,\n",
			"the mass of agents who are prepared to topple a government in a revolution, or the\n",
			"reserves of a central bank in a speculative attack against a regime of \ufb01xed exchange\n",
			"rate. Rational learning in this book means Bayesian learning about the state of nature.\n",
			"The essential tools of analysis are presented in Chapter 2. The private information\n",
			"is represented by private signals, which depend on the state of nature: for example,\n",
			"if it will rain (if the sun will shine), two-thirds (one-third) of the agents think that\n",
			"rain is more likely than sunshine. To think that rain is more (less) likely is the real-\n",
			"ization of a private signal. These private signals are correct, statistically, and a large\n",
			"number of them, if they could be pooled directly, would bring perfect or near-perfect\n",
			"information.\n",
			"\n",
			"We will use restrictive models, which will be special cases. Attempts at generality\n",
			"would end in futile formalism, but we will need to have a good idea whether the results\n",
			"of a speci\ufb01c model are robust or not. In most cases, these results depend on some\n",
			"critical assumptions. It is therefore important to know the implications of the mod-\n",
			"eling choices. Two models of private information will be used recurrently (but not\n",
			"exclusively): the binary model with two states (\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d), two informations,\n",
			"and two actions (\u201cinvestment\u201d or \u201cno investment\u201d), and the Gaussian\u2013quadratic\n",
			"model where all random variables are normal and the payoff is a quadratic function\n",
			"of the level of action (a real number). These two models are discussed in detail in\n",
			"Chapter 2.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Martingale Property\n",
			"The beliefs of agents are de\ufb01ned as their subjective probabilities about the state\n",
			"of nature. An agent observes a variable (aggregate investment, success or failure\n",
			"of an oil drilling) that depends on the state of nature. Following an observation,\n",
			"he updates his belief using Bayes\u2019s rule. This rule is an application of the calculus\n",
			"of conditional probabilities, and it generates the remarkable property of a martin-\n",
			"gale: an agent knows that he may change his belief after an observation, but the\n",
			"expected value of the change is nil. If that value were different from zero, the agent\n",
			"would change his belief right away. The martingale property, which is similar to\n",
			"\n",
			"\f4\n",
			"\n",
			"Introduction\n",
			"\n",
			"an ef\ufb01cient-market equation in \ufb01nance (and for good reasons), is both simple and\n",
			"powerful; it implies that the agent cannot change his belief forever. The martingale\n",
			"convergence theorem is one of the most beautiful theorems in probability theory.\n",
			"Its mechanism is presented here intuitively. The theorem is the most important\n",
			"one in Bayesian learning. It will apply in many models (but not in all of them)\n",
			"and facilitate the analysis of the limit properties of learning. The theorem implies\n",
			"that unending \ufb02uctuations of individual beliefs cannot be compatible with rational\n",
			"learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"Social Learning\n",
			"When an individual learns from a person\u2019s behavior, (i.e., her choice of action or her\n",
			"words), he learns because the person\u2019s behavior is motivated by some information that\n",
			"she has about a state of nature of interest to all (e.g., the example of the umbrellas).\n",
			"This private information, or private belief, is like an endowment. The process of social\n",
			"learning is the diffusion of the private beliefs to all individuals through the interactions\n",
			"of observations, learning, and action choices. The structure of the model will be\n",
			"dictated by the context. Actions may be more reliable than words. Some de\ufb01nitions of\n",
			"social learning restrict the learning to the observation of actions themselves (physical\n",
			"actions or words), but we will consider also the observation of the outcomes of actions.\n",
			"In models of social learning, a large amount of (private) information may be\n",
			"hidden. When agents do not act, this information remains hidden. We will encounter\n",
			"situations where, because of some small changes, some agents will \u201ccome out of the\n",
			"woods,\u201d take an action, and thereby release their information and induce others to act.\n",
			"Long periods of low activity may be followed by a sudden boom. Inversely, a regime\n",
			"of high activity may be brought to a halt by a crash.\n",
			"\n",
			"Actions as Words\n",
			"When agents learn from actions, these actions are the \u201cwords\u201d for communication.\n",
			"As in any language, communication is easier if there are many words. When actions\n",
			"can be taken from a wide set (e.g., the set of real numbers), the \u201cmessage\u201d sent by an\n",
			"agent can re\ufb02ect his private information perfectly. When the set of actions is discrete\n",
			"(e.g., a farmer choosing the type of crop), the message about the private information\n",
			"is obviously more coarse. We begin with the case of continuous action sets.\n",
			"\n",
			"Clustering\n",
			"The model of social learning is introduced in Chapter 3: Agents are placed in an\n",
			"exogenous sequence of rounds; each agent chooses his level of investment, a real\n",
			"number, in his round and is observed by others. As the number of observations\n",
			"increases, the importance of history for individual choices grows and agents rely less,\n",
			"rationally, on their private information. Individual choices are clustering. However,\n",
			"any agent\u2019s action can be observed with perfect precision \u2013 in this model \u2013 and it reveals\n",
			"perfectly his private information. The learning from others\u2019 actions is equivalent to\n",
			"\n",
			"\f1.1 Overview\n",
			"\n",
			"5\n",
			"\n",
			"the direct observation of their private information. There is no information loss in\n",
			"social learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Weight of History and Slow Learning from Others\n",
			"The assumption of perfect observability requires also perfect knowledge of the deci-\n",
			"sion process of each agent. However, we have all our idiosyncrasies, which make the\n",
			"inference from actions imperfect. When history is short, this problem is not impor-\n",
			"tant. When history is long, however, and it induces agents to cluster, the observation\n",
			"becomes dominated by the noise. This slowing down in the rate of social learning is\n",
			"quanti\ufb01ed by Vives (1995) in the Gauss\u2013quadratic model. We will \ufb01nd this important\n",
			"property of social learning in other contexts: the memory of past actions may reduce \u2013\n",
			"or completely prevent \u2013 social learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"Herds and Cascades\n",
			"In Chapter 4, the set of actions is reduced to two elements (to take or not an action:\n",
			"\ufb01xed investment, medical procedure, new crop). This is the celebrated model of\n",
			"Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer, and Welch (1992), hereafter BHW. In a simple case (with\n",
			"binary information), they show that social learning stops completely and rapidly (at\n",
			"an exponential rate): Suppose two agents invest and thus reveal that they have a good\n",
			"signal; if the third agent has a bad signal, that signal cancels only one of the previous\n",
			"two signals; he should invest like the \ufb01rst agent, who had only one good signal to\n",
			"rely on; in this case, he invests even if he has a bad signal. The third agent is herding.\n",
			"His action conveys no information. In the next round, the public information is\n",
			"unchanged. Nothing is learned. The fourth agent is in the same position as the third.\n",
			"Social learning stops completely, and a cascade takes place.2\n",
			"\n",
			"Cascades are a spectacular example of the failure of social learning due to the\n",
			"weight of history. Is this property robust? Careful examination shows that, technically,\n",
			"the property is not robust at all. Cascades depend on discrete private signals that are\n",
			"not generic. When private beliefs are all distinct \u2013 as in random drawings from a\n",
			"continuum \u2013 cascades do not exist.\n",
			"\n",
			"On the other hand, herds take place for sure, eventually. A herd is de\ufb01ned as a\n",
			"situation in which all agents take the same action after some date. If all agents turn\n",
			"out to take the same action after some date T, there is still the possibility that an\n",
			"agent has a private signal that induces him to take a different action after date T. This\n",
			"possibility is not realized, but the very fact that it is not realized yields information,\n",
			"which is incorporated in the social learning (Smith and S\u00f8rensen, 2001).\n",
			"\n",
			"The existence of a herd is an elegant application of the martingale convergence\n",
			"theorem: when a \u201cblack sheep\u201d breaks away from the herd, he reveals a piece of strong\n",
			"private information. That information is then incorporated in the public belief, which\n",
			"\n",
			"2 See Section 1.2 for a discussion of the term \u201ccascade\u201d.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f6\n",
			"\n",
			"Introduction\n",
			"\n",
			"makes a quantum jump. This event cannot occur an in\ufb01nite number of times, because\n",
			"that would prevent the convergence of the public belief, which is a martingale.\n",
			"\n",
			"A herd is not a cascade. However, as a herd goes on, the set of private beliefs\n",
			"in which an agent follows the herd grows. Social learning is very slow, because the\n",
			"probability of breaking the herd must be vanishingly small in order for the herd to\n",
			"be realized. The time pro\ufb01le of the evolution of beliefs is not the same as that of a\n",
			"cascade, where learning stops completely, but it is not very different.\n",
			"\n",
			"An application of the model shows that a \ufb01rm that introduces a new product of\n",
			"quality unknown to consumers should target a group willing to pay a high price, in\n",
			"order to establish its reputation, and then lower the price to reach a mass market.\n",
			"\n",
			"To Forget in Order to Reduce the Weight of History\n",
			"Because the weight of the information in history induces paralysis and prevents agents\n",
			"from conveying their information to others through their actions, the remedy is\n",
			"simple: partly forget the past. Indeed, Chapter 5 shows that when agents have an\n",
			"incomplete sample of the actions of past agents, social learning is more ef\ufb01cient!\n",
			"The inference from another individual\u2019s action is now more dif\ufb01cult, because the\n",
			"observations on which that action is based are not observable. (In Chapter 4 these\n",
			"observations were summarized by the public belief, which is a martingale.)\n",
			"\n",
			"Delays Ending with a Bang or a Whimper\n",
			"So far agents have made a choice in an exogenous order. This assumption cannot apply\n",
			"to the penguins. In Chapter 6, the setting is the same as in BHW (with arbitrary private\n",
			"beliefs) with the sole difference that any agent can make a decision (like plunging) at\n",
			"any time: each agent has an option to make one investment. This setting induces a\n",
			"waiting game, in which the more optimistic agents go \ufb01rst. The others know this and\n",
			"wait to observe how many agents plunge. A large number means that the number of\n",
			"optimists is large. Because private beliefs are statistically correct, the large number is a\n",
			"signal that the state of nature is good, and agents who were initially reluctant join the\n",
			"fray. A bang may take place. Events can evolve either way: there is also the possibility\n",
			"that the number of investors is small in an initial phase, after which investment stops\n",
			"completely. The game ends with a whimper (Chamley and Gale, 1994).\n",
			"\n",
			"The waiting game has some powerful properties. The main one is the arbitrage\n",
			"between the cost of delay (from lost dividends) and the option value of delay (from\n",
			"not making a bad irreversible investment). Suppose that actions are observed through\n",
			"some noise. The cost of delay is not affected by the noise. Hence the information\n",
			"generated by the equilibrium is unaffected. The equilibrium strategy is adjusted so\n",
			"that more agents take action, and the net information generated by all actions is\n",
			"the same as without noise. The model may generate multiple equilibria with sharply\n",
			"different information: if most agents delay and only the greatest optimists invest,\n",
			"then the information generated by the equilibrium must be high (in order to induce\n",
			"most agents to wait). If most agents do not delay, there is little information in the\n",
			"\n",
			"\f1.1 Overview\n",
			"\n",
			"7\n",
			"\n",
			"equilibrium. In the cascades of BHW, there was no information. These situations are\n",
			"found again in the setting with endogenous delays.\n",
			"\n",
			"In Chapter 7, the model with delays is investigated under the assumption of\n",
			"continuous time: agents can make a decision at any point in time. If the distribution\n",
			"of private beliefs admits agents with a high degree of optimism, the model does\n",
			"not have an equilibrium, generically. It is shown that there are essential differences\n",
			"between a model with periods and a model in continuous time. The properties of\n",
			"a model with periods do not converge to those of a continuous-time model as the\n",
			"period length becomes vanishingly short.\n",
			"\n",
			"Outcomes\n",
			"When agents observe the outcomes of others\u2019 actions, learning may still be incomplete\n",
			"if actions converge to a point where the random outcome can be explained by different\n",
			"states, as shown in Chapter 8. For example, the individual level of effort toward a\n",
			"successful economic career may converge, generically, to a value where agents cannot\n",
			"discriminate perfectly between the contributions of noise and chance in the outcome;\n",
			"or the price of a monopoly may be compatible with two types of demand schedule:\n",
			"the \ufb01rst with a high level and a high price elasticity, the second with a low level and a\n",
			"low elasticity.\n",
			"\n",
			"The observation of outputs does not prevent failures in social learning: if an action\n",
			"is deemed superior to others, it is chosen by all agents who do not try other actions.\n",
			"Hence, no information can be gathered on other actions to induce a switch. A herd\n",
			"may take place unless some agents have very strong private beliefs that other actions\n",
			"may be superior. These strong believers may provide signi\ufb01cant information bene\ufb01ts\n",
			"to others.\n",
			"\n",
			"Networks\n",
			"When agents are watching the evolution of the price of an asset, the information has\n",
			"a sequential structure. When they learn how to fertilize apple trees in Ghana, they\n",
			"rely on a network of information contacts. When a new crop (say, a high-yield variety\n",
			"of wheat or rice) is introduced in a region, agents make simultaneous decisions in\n",
			"each crop cycle, and learn from their information contacts at the end of each cycle.\n",
			"Networks and diffusion processes are analyzed in Chapter 9. As in previous chapters,\n",
			"social learning may be more ef\ufb01cient if the information of agents is restricted. For\n",
			"example, the observation of a small group (e.g., a royal family) by all agents could\n",
			"induce a cascade and a herd. The model of Bala and Goyal (1998) formalizes the\n",
			"description of Tarde (1900), which will be presented below.\n",
			"\n",
			"Words\n",
			"The most obvious way to communicate private information seems to be to talk.\n",
			"Yet, economists prefer to trust what people do. Can a \ufb01nancial advisor be trusted?\n",
			"Yes, if he has suf\ufb01cient incentive to build a reputation for his future business. In\n",
			"\n",
			"\f8\n",
			"\n",
			"Introduction\n",
			"\n",
			"Chapter 10, it is shown that the reputation motive can be suf\ufb01cient for truthtelling\n",
			"within some limits. The reputation is earned by being proven right: the receiver of the\n",
			"advice can verify, after a while, whether the stock that was recommended actually went\n",
			"up or down. However, if the public belief that the stock will go up is strong, a ratio-\n",
			"nal advisor who has contrary private information will maximize the chance of being\n",
			"right and will issue a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation. He is herding like any agent in the BHW\n",
			"model. Indeed, there is no difference between reputation herding and the herding in\n",
			"the BHW model, and the conditions for its occurrence are identical (Ottaviani and\n",
			"S\u00f8rensen, 2000). The reputation can induce people to herd and say the \u201cpolitically\n",
			"correct\u201d thing (Morris, 2001) or to please the boss (Prendergast, 1993). Recall the\n",
			"witnesses of the white van, or how the lonely juror was able to sway the others in\n",
			"Twelve Angry Men (Lumet, 1957). Who should speak \ufb01rst in a jury where people may\n",
			"herd on what others say? The analysis shows that it is not clear whether the \ufb01rst to speak\n",
			"should be among the more or the less experienced (Ottaviani and S\u00f8rensen, 2001).\n",
			"\n",
			"PART II: COORDINATION\n",
			"The issues of Part I are extended in Part II with the addition of payoff externalities\n",
			"between different individual actions. Agents have to coordinate their expectations\n",
			"about an equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"One Period without Learning\n",
			"Rousseau (1762) described the problem of social cooperation in the model of the\n",
			"stag hunt: a hunter has a higher individual payoff if he participates in a stag hunt\n",
			"than if he goes on his own chasing a hare. However, the success of the stag hunt\n",
			"depends on the participation of all. There are two equilibria in this game with strategic\n",
			"complementarity: either all hunters participate in the stag hunt or none do. This\n",
			"story can be adapted to a number a situations in economics, from business cycles to\n",
			"speculative attacks against a \ufb01xed exchange rate, and in other social situations (e.g.,\n",
			"revolutions).\n",
			"\n",
			"How do agents \u201cchoose\u201d between different equilibria? A natural \ufb01rst step for the\n",
			"analysis is to consider a one-period setting in which agents make a simultaneous\n",
			"decision without observing what others do. Each agent has to guess, if possible, which\n",
			"equilibrium agents coordinate on. Carlsson and van Damme (1993a), in their global-\n",
			"game method, build on the insight that agents do not have perfect information on\n",
			"each other. The removal of the assumption of common knowledge enables one to solve\n",
			"the coordination problem: agents with a low cost of investment invest, no matter what\n",
			"others do. With that information commonly known, agents with a slightly higher cost\n",
			"also invest, which is again common knowledge. A process of contagion takes place,\n",
			"which solves the decision problem for all agents with a cost lower than average. A\n",
			"similar process of iterative dominance induces agents with a cost higher than average\n",
			"not to invest. This process takes place in the heads of agents in \u201cvirtual time\u201d and is\n",
			"called eductive learning.\n",

			"Switching Regimes\n",
			"In 1989, countries in the former Soviet bloc switched their political regimes abruptly.\n",
			"The opportunities for change were not apparent in the preceding winter.3 It is the\n",
			"essence of oppressive regimes that a large amount of opinions remains hidden (Kuran,\n",
			"1995). A turning point was the series of demonstrations in Leipzig, where protesters\n",
			"realized that they were a large mass. After the fall, few people seemed surprised. The\n",
			"story\u2019s features include a strong complementarity between the actions of agents and\n",
			"a large discrepancy between the common knowledge before and after the fact. These\n",
			"features are the main ones in the model presented in Chapter 12, which is based on\n",
			"Chamley (1999). The model is suggestive of regime switches in a variety of contexts\n",
			"of social interactions (political regimes, business cycles).\n",
			"\n",
			"In each period, there is a new population where each agent decides whether to\n",
			"invest (protest, in a political context), or not. Investment entails a \ufb01xed cost, and the\n",
			"return is positive only if a suf\ufb01cient mass of agents invest in the same period. The costs\n",
			"of agents have some unobserved distribution. Each agent knows only his own cost and\n",
			"observes the history of aggregate activities in the previous periods. The distribution\n",
			"of costs evolves slowly and randomly. The model exhibits the properties described in\n",
			"the previous paragraph: there are random switches between regimes of low and high\n",
			"activity. Most of the time, the structure of costs is such that under perfect information\n",
			"there would be two equilibria, with high and low activity. Under perfect information,\n",
			"however, the level of aggregate activity moves between a high and a low value with\n",
			"signi\ufb01cant hysteresis, or inertia.\n",
			"\n",
			"The inertia can be described precisely. If an outside observer had perfect knowledge\n",
			"about the structure of the economy, he would observe that in any period, agents\n",
			"\n",

			"in Halberstam (1991) with an account of Henry Kissinger addressing, on February 26, 1989, the\n",
			"governors of the \ufb01fty states of the union: \u201cHe was condescending about what Gorbachev was doing\n",

			"Delays and Externalities\n",
			"Firms that enter a new sector generate negative externalities on each other because\n",
			"they lower the price of the good. At the same time, they provide outsiders some\n",
			"information about the cost of production or the size of the demand. The prospect of\n",
			"more information induces delays. When the externality is positive, a small number of\n",

			"PART III: FINANCIAL HERDS\n",
			"Since the tulip mania in seventeenth-century Holland, spectacular rises and falls have\n",
			"been observed in \ufb01nancial markets. It is easy to dismiss these as follies. An evaluation\n",
			"of the \u201cirrationality\u201d of markets can be made only with respect to properties that\n",
			"may be observed in a \u201crational\u201d market. Part III provides an introduction to herds in\n",
			"\ufb01nancial markets with rational agents.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the standard model of social learning (Part I), agents learn about the state of\n",
			"the world. The speci\ufb01cations of the set of actions and of the payoff externalities play\n",
			"a critical role in determining the properties of social learning. In \ufb01nancial markets,\n",
			"the state of the world is the fundamental value of an asset, the actions are the trades,\n",
			"payoff externalities arise because the gains of some are the losses of others, and timing\n",
			"is essential. Two market structures are considered.\n",
			"\n",
			"Sequential Trades\n",
			"The model of social learning with individuals in an exogenous sequence (Part I)\n",
			"becomes in \ufb01nancial markets the model of sequential trades between agents with\n",
			"different information (Glosten and Milgrom, 1985). If the learning is about a fun-\n",
			"damental value that is a real number, beliefs updated by \ufb01nancial transactions with\n",
			"asymmetric information converge rapidly to the truth. This property is not very sur-\n",
			"prising in view of the results in Part I. Because a price can take any value in the set\n",
			"of positive numbers, it is a \ufb01ne signal about the agents\u2019 private informations (as the\n",
			"\n",
			"\f1.1 Overview\n",
			"\n",
			"11\n",
			"\n",
			"actions in a continuum). In general, it seems that a state in an ordered set can be\n",
			"learned ef\ufb01ciently through \ufb01nancial markets.\n",
			"\n",
			"An interesting situation occurs when the states cannot be ordered. For example,\n",
			"the state may be de\ufb01ned by the value of the fundamental and by the precision of the\n",
			"private informations of the agents. The updating from the history of prices does not\n",
			"proceed by simple upward or downward revisions. A situation may develop in which\n",
			"the price is incorrect for a very long time because agents interpret the history along a\n",
			"particular line of thought. This line of thought may become untenable after extended\n",
			"lack of supporting evidence. Agents are then led to switch to another interpretation,\n",
			"which entails a price jump (Avery and Zemsky, 1995).\n",
			"\n",
			"No model of sequential \ufb01nancial trades has generated a cascade so far. However,\n",
			"the property of incorrect prices in protracted regimes followed by sudden and large\n",
			"changes \u2013 with no exogenous news \u2013 has the features of an unstable market that is\n",
			"apparently driven by fads.\n",
			"\n",
			"Herds may occur when agents do not make a unique bid as in the sequential\n",
			"model. In this case, individual bids depend strategically on the bids of others, as in an\n",
			"auction. There may be an equilibrium (nonunique) that exhibits herdlike behavior\n",
			"(Neeman and Orosel, 1999).\n",
			"\n",
			"Gaussian Markets and Price Jumps\n",
			"The sequential model of Part I with a large number of agents, quadratic payoffs, and\n",
			"Gaussian random variables becomes in \ufb01nancial markets the CARA\u2013Gauss model,\n",
			"where agents have a constant absolute risk aversion (hereafter CARA). In the standard\n",
			"CARA\u2013Gauss model, which is presented here from \ufb01rst principles, the information\n",
			"from history does not slow down social learning as in Part I. Agents reduce the weight of\n",
			"their private information in their estimates when the information from history grows\n",
			"over time, as in Part I. However, there is an additional effect: because the information\n",
			"from history reduces the uncertainty, agents take more risk, namely a larger position,\n",
			"which ampli\ufb01es the message about their private information. The second effect exactly\n",
			"cancels the \ufb01rst, and there is no slowdown of social learning if agents submit orders\n",
			"that are contingent on the trade prices (limit orders). If the orders are quantities to be\n",
			"traded at the rationally anticipated but uncertain equilibrium price (market orders),\n",
			"then social learning may slow down over time, as in Part I (Vives, 1995).\n",
			"\n",
			"The issue of instability is modeled here by the existence of multiple equilibria. As\n",
			"an introduction to the vast literature, a reduced version of the model of Genotte and\n",
			"Leland (1990) is presented in Chapter 15. This model adds a new type of agents who\n",
			"are motivated by portfolio insurance: they sell some of their asset holdings when the\n",
			"price falls and buy when the price rises. The key argument is that agents who trade on\n",
			"the fundamentals (the standard agents) do not know that portfolio traders play an\n",
			"important role. (The rational expectation of the existence of such traders is assumed\n",
			"to be low.) The combined actions of the standard traders (who interpret, incorrectly,\n",
			"a price fall as bad news about the fundamentals) and of the portfolio traders (who\n",
			"\n",
			"\f12\n",
			"\n",
			"Introduction\n",
			"\n",
			"sell when the price falls) can generate multiple equilibria. It is thus possible that small\n",
			"exogenous shocks induce large changes of the price.\n",
			"\n",
			"Activity and Endogenous Information in Financial Markets\n",
			"In models of social learning, a salient property is that the \ufb02ow of information depends\n",
			"on the level of agents\u2019 activity. Typically, a higher level of aggregate activity generates\n",
			"more information, which feeds into the behavior of individuals. A self-reinforcing\n",
			"process may lead to sudden changes. Chapter 16 presents three examples of this\n",
			"process and indicates directions for future research.\n",
			"\n",
			"Is it possible that in a \ufb01nancial market there could be two equilibria, the \ufb01rst with\n",
			"low activity associated with a high variance about the state, the second with high\n",
			"activity reducing the variance to a level that sustains that high activity? The answer is\n",
			"negative in the standard CARA\u2013Gauss model where the state is the value of an asset,\n",
			"because the multiplier from the private information of an agent to his demand is\n",
			"independent of the precision of the public information.\n",
			"\n",
			"The answer may be positive in a CARA\u2013Gauss model where the state is de\ufb01ned by\n",
			"the mass of agents. There may be one equilibrium with a low price because agents are\n",
			"unsure about their total mass (which is positively related to the demand and therefore\n",
			"the asset price in the future), and another with large aggregate demand, which reduces\n",
			"the variance about the future (and supports the high demand by individuals); a large\n",
			"mass of agents who \u201ccome out of the woods\u201d provides a strong signal about the state.\n",
			"\n",
			"Dynamic Speculative Attacks\n",
			"Speculative attacks against a \ufb01xed-exchange-rate regime and bank runs are examples\n",
			"of coordination games, but the people in the stag hunt do not decide one morning\n",
			"whether to hunt for the day or not. They watch each other; at any moment they can\n",
			"step in or out, depending on their observation. A one-period global game cannot take\n",
			"these effects into account. Chapter 16 presents a model of speculative attacks against\n",
			"a currency that is allowed to \ufb02uctuate within a narrow band (as in the European\n",
			"Monetary System before the euro). Agents face a trade-off in their timing: an early\n",
			"purchase of the foreign currency is made at a lower price, but the option to buy may\n",
			"be exercised later with a higher chance of success. On the other hand, an agent who\n",
			"delays faces the risk of missing the capital gain if he is beaten by others who trigger a\n",
			"devaluation. The model is built on the CARA\u2013Gauss model with market orders. The\n",
			"monotone relation between the level of activity and information is a key property of\n",
			"the model: agents learn that they form a mass that is able to trigger a devaluation only\n",
			"if the quantity of orders is suf\ufb01ciently large with respect to the noise.\n",
			"\n",
			"The End of Speculative Bubbles\n",
			"In the global-game approach to coordination, multiple equilibria are eliminated be-\n",
			"cause of the lack of common knowledge among agents: all individuals know that the\n",
			"stag hunt would succeed, but they do not know whether others know (at some stage\n",
			"\n",
			"\f1.2 A Bit of History\n",
			"\n",
			"13\n",
			"\n",
			"in the chain of re\ufb02ections). In a speculative bubble, agents hold the asset with the sole\n",
			"purpose of capital gain. Because the capital gain, without the supporting dividends,\n",
			"cannot last forever, the bubble has to burst. According to the standard methodology\n",
			"in \ufb01nance, the prospect of the eventual crash should, by backward induction, prevent\n",
			"the bubble. The bubble bursts only if the mass of agents selling the asset is suf\ufb01ciently\n",
			"large. Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003) present a model in which a bubble is sustain-\n",

			"Condorcet was the \ufb01rst to set the problem of aggregation of information and to\n",

			"second part (about 300 pages) states the propositions formally with pages and pages\n",
			"of algebraic computations.4\n",
			"\n",
			"The basic model of Condorcet is exactly the same as in any modern paper. There is\n",
			"a state of nature from a set of two elements, say, a person is guilty or not guilty. There\n",
			"is a set of individuals each with imperfect information on the state of nature. The\n",
			"imperfect information is modeled as a binary signal: with probability p, the person\u2019s\n",
			"opinion is correct. In the world of Condorcet, people expressed their true private\n",
			"beliefs. In our age of economists and accountants,5 we do not trust or even hear what\n",
			"they say, we simply want to see what they do or what they get.\n",
			"\n",
			"Condorcet assumes individuals express truthfully their opinion (reveal their signal,\n",
			"in modern jargon): they do not manipulate the process of decision; they do not let\n",
			"themselves be in\ufb02uenced by the opinion of others. Each opinion is expressed as a\n",
			"vote, and the decision follows the majority. This process is the same as learning from\n",
			"all agents with equal prior probabilities for the two events. Condorcet devoted many\n",

			"\n",
			"\f14\n",
			"\n",
			"Introduction\n",
			"\n",
			"France.6 Despite his academic success, Tarde was not a serious social scientist, even by\n",
			"generous standards. He preferred brilliance and striking insights over Gr\u00a8undlichkeit.\n",
			"Tarde is interesting here because of his vision of sociology, which can be recast\n",
			"in modern terms. Sociology deals with groups (aggregates) of individuals who share\n",
			"common features in their behavior. How do these aggregates behave? How do a large\n",
			"number of individuals behave in similar ways? These questions are similar to those\n",
			"in contemporary macroeconomics (e.g., how does an economy cycle?). According to\n",
			"Tarde (and to Margaret Thatcher), a group as such does not exist. Individuals exist.\n",
			"The group is made of the aggregation of individuals. The method is the same as in the\n",
			"microeconomic foundation of macroeconomics. For a sociologist, human behavior\n",
			"includes other facets than economics, such as beliefs, language, life decision (suicide).\n",
			"What makes individuals in a group act in similar ways? The answer, which must be\n",
			"based on the individual (which for Tarde means individual psychology), is imitation. It\n",
			"is hardly stretching his view to state that a group is a collection of herding individuals.\n",
			"Of course, there must be something to imitate. Indeed, some individuals do in-\n",
			"\n",
			"novate. These are few. Most individuals just imitate:\n",
			"\n",
			"The principal role of a nobility, its distinguishing mark, is its initiative, if not inventive\n",
			"character. Invention can start from the lowest ranks of the people, but its extension\n",

			"whence a continuous cascade of imitation may descend.7, 8\n",
			"\n",
			"A striking expression of Tarde\u2019s view is found in a comment on Tocqueville:\n",
			"\n",
			"In an attentive reading of Tocqueville it may be perceived that although he never\n",
			"troubles himself to formulate the principle of imitation he is always running across\n",
			"it, and curiously enumerating its consequences. But if he had expressed it clearly and\n",
			"placed it at the head of his deductions, he would, I think, have been spared many\n",
			"errors and contradictions. He justly remarks that \u201cno society can prosper without\n",
			"like beliefs, or, rather, there is none that subsists without them; for without common\n",
			"ideas, there is no common action, and without common action, men there may be,\n",
			"but not a social body.\u201d This means, at bottom, that the true social relation consists\n",
			"in imitation, since similarity of ideas, I mean of those ideas which are needed by\n",
			"society, is always acquired, never inborn. [. . .] Imitation, then, is the essential social\n",
			"action from which everything proceeds.9\n",
			"\n",
			"Tarde found his \u201cprinciple of imitation\u201d at work in important \ufb01elds of human\n",

			"\n",
			"We should even be amazed at the continuing necessity of discussing an hypothesis\n",

			"the frequency of suicides by district does not exhibit circles around cities. A model of\n",
			"imitation would require that cities set the trends, because they make communication\n",

			"\n",
			"An equilibrium with delays of the game with periods does not converge,\n",
			"in general, to an equilibrium of the game with the same payoff and\n",
			"information structures but where time is continuous. In important cases,\n",
			"there is no equilibrium with continuous time. A waiting game takes\n",
			"place when the information is generated by the payoffs of actions, as\n",
			"when penguins watch for killer whales, oil drillers observe the results of\n",
			"exploration in neighboring patches, or agents receive gradually private\n",
			"information.\n",
			"\n",
			"A model of economic growth or business cycles can be speci\ufb01ed in periods or in\n",
			"continuous time. Its properties do not depend on that choice. In discrete time, quan-\n",
			"tities like consumption or output in a period have the same dimension as the length\n",
			"of the period, and if that length is vanishingly small, their ratios to the length are\n",
			"asymptotically equal to the \ufb02ows of consumption and output in the continuous-time\n",
			"speci\ufb01cation. This equivalence fails, generically, in models of social learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"The essence of the equilibria with delay is the arbitrage between the opportunity\n",
			"cost of delay and the option value of delay, which is the expected value of undoing\n",
			"an investment after bad news. If the period shrinks, by arbitrage, the amount of\n",
			"information is smaller. However, this reduced information comes earlier. The overall\n",
			"effect is ambiguous, as shown in Section 7.1.1\n",
			"\n",
			"When the period length is vanishingly short, the option value of delay shrinks\n",
			"to zero. However, the variance of the change of beliefs remains bounded below by\n",
			"a strictly positive number (Section 7.1.2). The homogeneity of the dimension with\n",
			"respect to time that applies in models of capital accumulation, for example, does not\n",
			"apply in the model of social learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"Section 7.2 shows that the equilibrium properties of a model with continuous\n",
			"time are not the asymptotic properties of a model with vanishingly short periods.\n",
			"When an agent holds an option to invest (to choose an action x in a set \u0001), the\n",
			"\n",
			"149\n",
			"\n",
			"\f150\n",
			"\n",
			"More Delays\n",
			"\n",
			"bene\ufb01t of delaying for an in\ufb01nitesimal amount of time is the difference between the\n",
			"expected value of the capital gain of the option if some good news occurs during\n",
			"the in\ufb01nitesimal time interval and the capital loss if there is no good news. This\n",
			"difference must be positive to compensate for the cost of delaying (which is the value\n",
			"of the option multiplied by the rate of discount). The difference between the two\n",
			"terms depends on the distribution of the state of nature and the private information.\n",
			"In general, its sign is ambiguous. If it is negative, there cannot be an equilibrium with\n",
			"delay, and it is possible that there is no symmetric equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"Two cases are considered. The \ufb01rst is the simplest model with delay of Section 6.1\n",
			"\n",
			"with discrete actions. In continuous time, this model has no equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the second case, the structure is similar to the one in Chapter 3: agents maximize\n",
			"a quadratic payoff with an action taken in the set of real numbers. Their private\n",
			"information is derived from a SBS with a uniform distribution of precisions. This\n",
			"model has no equilibrium if there are agents who are suf\ufb01ciently optimistic (with a\n",
			"belief greater than 1\n",
			"\n",
			"2 ).\n",
			"\n",
			"The interpretation of the property is intuitive. The essential mechanism for the\n",
			"existence of an equilibrium with delay in continuous time is the expected capital\n",
			"gain on the value of the option, which arrives by a Poisson process. If the expected\n",
			"value of the capital gain is low, there is no suf\ufb01cient incentive to hold the option, and\n",
			"the arbitrage fails. If there is no arbitrage, a positive mass of agents invests without\n",
			"delay, thus providing instantly a discrete amount of information on the state, which\n",
			"is incompatible with immediate investment. In the model considered here, for agents\n",
			"with suf\ufb01ciently high beliefs, the expected value of good news is relatively small\n",
			"because they are already optimistic and the highest value of \u03b8 is 1. When the upper\n",
			"bound of the distribution of beliefs is not too large (less than 1\n",
			"2 here), the capital gain\n",
			"induced by the investment of the other agents is higher and arbitrage can sustain an\n",
			"equilibrium with delay.\n",
			"\n",
			"Gul and Lundholm (1995) present a model with delay in continuous time. The pre-\n",
			"vious analysis shows that they obtain an equilibrium only because of their particular\n",
			"assumption on the private signals.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the remaining sections of the chapter, time is divided into periods. In Section\n",
			"7.3, each agent receives a sequence of private signals as in Caplin and Leahy (1994).\n",
			"The model turns out to be very similar to the one in the previous chapter.\n",
			"\n",
			"In Section 7.4, agents observe the results of actions. For example, penguins are\n",
			"waiting on a cliff for the \ufb01rst fellow to plunge and \ufb01nd out whether a killer whale\n",
			"is roaming around. The same issue arises for oil drillers who may pay the cost of\n",
			"exploration or wait to see the results of others.\n",
			"\n",
			"Another example of delays with the observation of the payoff of actions has been\n",
			"analyzed by Caplin and Leahy (1998): at the southern end of Sixth Avenue, a number\n",
			"of buildings were vacant for a long time. Then Bed Bath & Beyond (BB&B) opened a\n",
			"retail store, which turned out to be very successful. It was followed by a rapid increase\n",
			"of other stores in the same neighborhood. The rents of the new leases were higher\n",
			"than that of the \ufb01rst lease.\n",

			"7.1.1 Are Longer Periods More Efficient?\n",
			"\n",
			"A longer period raises the cost of waiting for information, which is available only at the\n",
			"beginning of the next period. It induces more activity and more information. Because\n",
			"this information is discounted from the next period, the overall effect is ambiguous.\n",
			"Consider the following example: there are three agents and a distribution of private\n",
			"\n",
			"information such that\n",
			"\n",
			"\u2022 in the good state (\u03b8 = 1), two agents (optimists) have a belief equal to \u00b5+ = 2\n",

			"The cost of investment is c = 4\n",
			"7 , and the payoff of investment is \u03b8 \u2212 c. This example\n",
			"is analyzed in Exercise 7.2. In an equilibrium, no pessimist invests before an optimist,\n",
			"and the game is actually played by the optimists. Because they arbitrage between\n",
			"investment and delay, the value of the game for an optimist is the value of investment\n",
			"in the \ufb01rst period and does not depend on the period length. The issue is the value of\n",
			"the game for a pessimistic agent.\n",
			"\n",
			"Exercise 7.2 shows that the value of the game for the pessimists is a nonmonotone\n",
			"\n",
			"function of the discount factor.1\n",
			"\n",
			"7.1.2 Vanishingly Short Periods\n",
			"\n",
			"Consider the simplest model of delay, presented at the beginning of the previous\n",
			"chapter (Section 6.1): there are two players with an option to invest in the good\n",
			"state (\u03b8 = 1), and only one player in the bad state (\u03b8 = 0). The unique symmetric\n",
			"equilibrium in the \ufb01rst period is de\ufb01ned by the probability of investment \u03b6 and is\n",
			"solution of\n",
			"\n",
			"\u00b5 \u2212 c = \u03b4\u03b6 (1 \u2212 c),\n",
			"\n",
			"where \u00b5 is the belief of a player. The discount factor \u03b4 is related to the period length\n",
			"\u03c4 and to the discount rate per unit of time, \u03c1, with \u03b4 = e\n",
			"\u2212\u03c1\u03c4 . If the period length\n",
			"tends to zero, for \ufb01xed \u03c1, we have \u03b4 \u2192 1, and the strategy \u03b6 converges to \u02c6\u03b6 de\ufb01ned\n",
			"by \u00b5 \u2212 c = \u02c6\u03b6 (1 \u2212 c). The limit value \u02c6\u03b6 is strictly between 0 and 1. For any period\n",
			"length, even small, there is a symmetric PBE.\n",
			"Recall that at the end of the \ufb01rst period, either one agent has invested, in which\n",
			"case the belief (the probability that \u03b8 = 1) jumps to 1, or there is no investment, in\n",
			"\n",
			"1 If \u03b4 < 1\n",
			"3 , optimists do not delay, because of the low discount factor. Pessimists would prefer to\n",
			"have that information earlier. The value of the game increases with \u03b4 (decreases with an increasing\n",
			"discount rate). There is an equilibrium with delay if \u03b4 \u2208 ( 1\n",
			"3 , 1). In that interval, the value of the game\n",
			"for the pessimists is \ufb01rst decreasing, then increasing.\n",

			"\f152\n",
			"\n",
			"More Delays\n",
			"\n",
			"which case the belief jumps to a value smaller than c and there is no investment any\n",
			"more. If the period is vanishingly short, the value of these jumps remains bounded\n",
			"away from 0 and their probabilities are also bounded away from 0: for an outside\n",
			"observer, the probability of a jump down is (1 \u2212 \u03b6 )2 in the good state, and it converges\n",
			"to (1 \u2212 \u02c6\u03b6 )2 > 0 when \u03c4 \u2192 0. Hence, the variance of the change of belief does not\n",
			"become vanishingly small when the period is vanishingly short, but remains bounded\n",
			"away from 0. Per unit of time, the variance of the change of the public belief between\n",
			"the beginning and the end of the \ufb01rst period tends to in\ufb01nity.\n",
			"\n",
			"This nonhomogeneity of the variation of beliefs with respect to time stands in\n",
			"stark contrast with some other economic models: in an intertemporal general equi-\n",
			"librium model of capital accumulation, the quantities of consumption and output\n",
			"are proportional to the length of the period. The quantity of information in a model\n",
			"of social learning with discrete periods does not have the dimension of a \ufb02ow. The\n",
			"settings with vanishingly short periods and continuous time are essentially different.\n",
			"The properties of this simple model are analyzed formally in Exercise 7.1. They are\n",
			"generalized to a setting with N players and arbitrary distributions of private beliefs\n",
			"in Chamley (2003a). It is shown that when \u03b4 \u2192 1, (i) the probability of a permanent\n",
			"collapse of investment tends to a strictly positive value; (ii) the game stops with no\n",
			"investment only after the observation of no investment (x = 0), and goes on after any\n",
			"positive amount of investment (if there is a remaining player); (iii) the expected value\n",
			"of bad news must converge to 0. A good exercise is to derive the intuition for these\n",
			"properties from the arbitrage between the opportunity cost and the option value of\n",
			"delay.\n",

			"\n",
			"7.2.1 The Nonexistence of an Equilibrium with Discrete Actions\n",
			"\n",
			"We continue with the simple model of the previous section with one or two players\n",
			"and assume that time is continuous: a player can take the action x = 1 at any point\n",
			"in time and observe the action of the other (if there is any) immediately after it is\n",
			"taken. Let \u00b5t be the belief of a player at time t with \u00b50 > c given. We consider only\n",
			"symmetric PBEs.\n",
			"\n",
			"Immediate investment at time 0 cannot be an equilibrium strategy, because it is\n",
			"dominated by a small delay. Suppose now that the player delays for a time interval\n",
			"(t, t + dt), t \u2265 0, conditional on no investment before time t. If he does not see any\n",
			"investment by the other agent during that interval, and he is still willing to invest at\n",
			"time t + dt, then he is willing to invest at time t + dt whatever the news during the\n",
			"time interval (t, t + dt). The present value of that strategy is the value of immediate\n",
			"investment, discounted by the rate \u03c1dt. This argument, which was presented in the\n",
			"previous chapter, shows that there cannot be an equilibrium with delay. There is no\n",
			"equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f7.2 Continuous Time\n",
			"\n",
			"153\n",
			"\n",
			"Exercise 7.3 shows that the right-hand side of the arbitrage equation is equal to\n",
			"0. The delay cannot yield a return that compensates for the cost of delay per unit of\n",
			"time, \u03c1(\u00b5t \u2212 c).\n",
			"\n",
			"The same argument applies in the central model of the previous chapter with N\n",
			"agents if the cost of investment, c, is in the interior of the support of beliefs. In this\n",
			"case, any agent with belief smaller than c does not invest at time 0. If all agents with a\n",
			"belief greater than \u00b5\u2217 \u2265 c invest at time 0, the aggregate investment at time 0 provides\n",
			"information about the state \u03b8, and a small delay dominates immediate investment.\n",
			"When the previous argument is used, there cannot be an equilibrium with delay.\n",
			"There is no symmetric equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"If all agents have a belief at least equal to c, then a rush in which all agents invest\n",
			"immediately is an equilibrium. In such a rush the total investment is independent of\n",
			"the state of nature and conveys no information. As in the setting with periods, there\n",
			"is no incentive to delay, and immediate investment is an equilibrium strategy.2\n",
			"\n",
			"When the period length is vanishingly short, the cost of delay is vanishingly small,\n",

			"\n",
			"2 Zhang (1997) considers a model of investment in continuous time that is equivalent to the case\n",
			"where the lower bound of the distribution of beliefs is equal to the cost of investment. Zhang claims\n",
			"rightly that there is only one equilibrium with a herd (which is called a rush here). From the present\n",

			"We focus on a symmetric equilibrium. In such an equilibrium, immediate invest-\n",
			"ment at time 0 cannot be an equilibrium strategy, because it would be dominated by a\n",
			"small delay. If an agent has invested, there is no gain from further delay and the other\n",
			"agent invests immediately. A symmetric equilibrium strategy should therefore be a\n",
			"function from the signal s to the time t(s ), possibly in\ufb01nite, such that if no agent has\n",
			"invested before time t, the agent with signal s invests at time t. Let s (t) be the inverse of\n",
			"this function. If the agent invests at time t, he must be indifferent between investment\n",
			"and a small delay. The opportunity cost of delay has the dimension of the length dt.\n",
			"Therefore the probability that the other agent invests in the time interval (t, t + dt)\n",
			"(cid:2)\n",
			"must also have the dimensions of dt. This event is equivalent to having the signal s\n",

			"7.4 Observation of Payoffs\n",
			"\n",
			"So far in this book, social learning has operated through the observation of actions.\n",
			"Actions are informative because they depend on informative private beliefs. In a variety\n",
			"of contexts, the results of the actions also convey important information. Penguins on\n",
			"an Antarctic cliff wait for someone to jump and reveal whether a killer whale is roaming\n",
			"around. Oil drillers learn from the success or failure of neighboring wells. Academic\n",
			"researchers follow successful colleagues into new areas of investigation. We consider\n",
			"now a simple model, which has been motivated by the example of oil exploration.\n",
			"The main property of the model, which is due to Hendricks and Kovenock (1989),\n",
			"rests on the arbitrage between the payoff of immediate investment and delay, as in the\n",
			"model of Chamley and Gale (1994).\n",
			"\n",
			"DRILLING FOR OIL (HENDRICKS AND KOVENOCK, 1989)\n",
			"There are N companies, which own adjacent tracts for exploration. All the tracts\n",
			"contain the same amount of oil, and there is no \ufb02ow from one tract to another (for\n",
			"simplicity). Drilling entails a \ufb01xed cost. The \ufb01rst company that drills will \ufb01nd out if\n",
			"there is oil in its tract. If oil spurts from the well, it can be seen by all. There is an\n",
			"informational externality in the observation of the drilling\u2019s payoff. Companies have\n",
			"an incentive not to delay drilling, because of the discount rate; but they have also an\n",
			"incentive to delay and \ufb01nd out whether the other company has struck oil.\n",
			"There are two states of nature, \u03b8 = 0 or 1, with prior probability \u00b5 for state 1. There\n",
			"are N agents i = 1, . . . , N, who all have the same belief. Until now, information has\n",
			"been obtained from the observation of actions that were function of the private\n",
			"beliefs. In that context, it was essential for the distribution of beliefs (and therefore of\n",
			"actions) to depend on the state \u03b8. In the present context, the introduction of different\n",
			"\n",
			"\f162\n",
			"\n",
			"More Delays\n",
			"\n",
			"private beliefs would distract us from the main issue. We assume therefore that all\n",
			"agents have the same belief \u00b51 in the \ufb01rst period. This belief satis\ufb01es the following\n",
			"assumption.\n",
			"ASSUMPTION 7.1 0 < \u00b51 \u2212 c < \u03b4\u00b51(1 \u2212 c).\n",

			"Under Assumption 7.1, agents cannot invest for sure in the \ufb01rst period in a sym-\n",
			"metric PBE: delaying would yield perfect information. There cannot be an equilibrium\n",
			"in which all agents delay for sure, according to an argument similar to that in Chamley\n",
			"and Gale (1994). Note that there is strategic substitutability. If all agents increase their\n",
			"probability of investment, delaying yields more information and the option value\n",
			"increases. This induces each agent to reduce its (probability of) investment. There is\n",
			"a unique symmetric PBE.\n",
			"\n",
			"Let \u03b6 be the probability of investment of each agent. By the previous arguments,\n",
			"0 < \u03b6 < 1. If there is an equilibrium, agents are indifferent between investment with\n",
			"no delay and delay. Hence, the value of the game is the value of investment in the \ufb01rst\n",
			"period, \u00b5 \u2212 c. If an agent delays, the probability that at least one of the N \u2212 1 other\n",

			"\u03c0 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b6 )N\u22121. If no agent invests in the \ufb01rst period, nothing is learned.11 The\n",

			"Three issues of current research are introduced in this chapter. The \ufb01rst is the analysis\n",
			"of speculative attacks, or stag hunts in general, in a multiperiod context. The one-\n",
			"period framework of Chapter 11 does not allow for any learning from the actions of\n",
			"others. It seems that in a speculative attack, against a currency or in a bank run, agents\n",
			"observe the actions of others and optimize the timing of their actions. In Chapter 12,\n",
			"agents observed the actions of others, but they could not, by assumption, optimize\n",
			"when to invest. The optimization of timing is one of the main issues in the model of\n",
			"dynamic speculative attacks, which is presented in Section 16.1.\n",
			"\n",
			"In Section 16.2, the permanent value of an asset is increasing in the number\n",
			"of buyers, and the uncertainty is about the number of the potential buyers, i.e., the\n",
			"number of agents. This positive relation between the value of the asset and the number\n",
			"of agents is similar to that in previous chapters when there are information or payoff\n",
			"externalities. In equilibrium, a higher level of purchases generates more information\n",
			"about a large number of agents, as in Chapter 6. There may be multiple equilibria; in\n",
			"one of them, a high level of demand may generate a strong signal that the number of\n",
			"agents is indeed large; in another, the demand may be low and the uncertainty about\n",
			"the number of agents remains high, which will keep the demand low.\n",
			"\n",

			"(2003) introduce a lack of common knowledge about the time when the extraordinary\n",
			"growth stops: at that time, the mass of agents who are aware that the price is above the\n",
			"fundamentals grows gradually over time. Agents ride the bubble for a while, because\n",

			"\n",
			"16.1 Speculative Attacks against a Fixed Exchange Rate\n",
			"\n",
			"Regimes of \ufb01xed exchange rates are opportunities for speculative attacks, which are\n",
			"similar to stag-hunt games. In a one-period setting, the global-game method resolves\n",
			"the problem of selection between multiple equilibria (Section 11.4). However, it fails\n",
			"to embody some important features of currency markets.\n",
			"\n",
			"(i) An essential property of the one-period model is that all agents have to make a\n",
			"decision once and simultaneously. There is no interaction between the learning\n",
			"from others\u2019 actions and strategic decisions (i.e., to speculate now or delay after\n",
			"some observation of others\u2019 actions). Actual currency attacks may be short, but\n",
			"during an attack, agents intensively observe the actions taken by others and react\n",
			"quickly to their perceptions of these actions.\n",
			"\n",
			"(ii) The global-game method requires the distribution to have a tail of agents on each\n",
			"side for whom the dominant strategy is to attack or not to attack the currency. In\n",
			"a multiperiod context, one tail may disappear (e.g., the tail of agents with high\n",
			"expectations who exercise their option to attack the currency), and the method\n",
			"is not applicable in the following period unless a new shock regenerates the tail.1\n",
			"If the period is short (as it should be in speculative attacks), such a new shock is\n",
			"asymptotically equivalent to a discontinuous jump of the parameters and may\n",
			"not be plausible.\n",
			"\n",
			"(iii) A \ufb01xed transaction cost plays a critical role in the one-period model. When that\n",
			"cost is vanishingly small, the difference between the sustainable exchange rate\n",
			"and the fundamental exchange rate is also vanishingly small. A realistic value of\n",
			"this cost as a fraction of the transaction is very small for positions that last just a\n",
			"few days.\n",
			"\n",
			"(iv) The model assumes that the exchange rate is \ufb01xed with absolutely no room for\n",
			"variations. Unless the currency belongs to a monetary zone (as did the euro\n",
			"between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002), some \ufb02uctuations (as in the\n",
			"\n",
			"1 Morris and Shin (1998b) consider a sequence of one-period models with no strategic decisions.\n",
			"The state of nature \u03b8t evolves randomly from period to period. The assumption that \u03b8t is learned\n",
			"exogenously in period t + 1 rules out social learning. In any case, the exogenous learning seems a bit\n",
			"slow compared to the time frame of a speculative attack. Corsetti et al. (2000) consider the strategic\n",
			"behavior of a large player and in\ufb01nitesimal players. Given the assumption of the model, the outcome\n",
			"is trivial with the large player moving \ufb01rst.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f360\n",
			"\n",
			"Financial Frenzies\n",
			"\n",
			"regime before 1999) are allowed. These \ufb02uctuations have two opposite effects.\n",
			"The \ufb01rst is to provide a channel of communication. A speculative attack typically\n",
			"induces a depreciation of the exchange rate within the allowed band before any\n",
			"devaluation. This communication increases the risk of an attack. The second\n",
			"effect reduces this risk by introducing a penalty if the attack fails: after a failed\n",
			"attack, the price of the foreign currency falls, thus generating a loss for the holders\n",
			"of the foreign currency. This penalty is incurred without any ad hoc transaction\n",
			"cost.\n",
			"\n",
			"(v) The payoff after the abandonment of the \ufb01xed rate is independent of the actions\n",
			"of the players if the attack is successful. All the bids are carried out at the old\n",
			"exchange rate, and the speculators gain from the devaluation. However, actual\n",
			"players in a dynamic game face the risk of arriving at the window too late. This\n",
			"is obviously why they may want to rush, as in a bank run. The model should\n",
			"incorporate the trade-off between going early at a smaller cost (with a favorable\n",
			"exchange rate) and little information, and delaying for more information with\n",
			"the risk of coming too late.\n",
			"\n",
			"(vi) In most models of speculative attacks, the central bank has perfect information\n",
			"on the state of the world. However, a critical factor for the success of a specu-\n",
			"lative attack is the distribution of characteristics of the speculators about which\n",
			"the central bank may not have superior information. The one-period approach\n",
			"does not leave much room for the role of the central bank during a speculative\n",
			"attack.\n",
			"\n",
			"These issues are addressed in Section 16.1 with a model where agents act strategi-\n",
			"cally in a multiperiod context. The equilibrium exchange rate is allowed to \ufb02uctuate\n",
			"within a band, and a devaluation takes place only if the ceiling of the band is reached.\n",
			"The mass of these speculators is the uncertain parameter in the economy. For sim-\n",
			"plicity, there are two states of nature. In one of the two states, the high state, the mass\n",
			"of speculators is suf\ufb01ciently large to induce a devaluation if all speculators buy the\n",
			"foreign currency; in the other, low state, that mass is subcritical.\n",
			"\n",
			"The emphasis is not on the resolution of multiple equilibria as in the global-\n",
			"game approach, but on the opportunities offered by the dynamic setting for specu-\n",
			"lative attacks when agents have heterogeneous expectations on the mass of potential\n",
			"speculators. In all the cases considered here, there will be an equilibrium with no\n",
			"speculative attack. Under some conditions, there will also be an equilibrium with a\n",
			"speculative attack. The role of policy, if any, will be to abolish this second equilibrium.\n",
			"The strategic aspect is critical: the interesting cases occur when the parameters of the\n",
			"model are such that if there is one-period (and thus no opportunity to learn from\n",
			"others), there is a unique equilibrium with no attack.\n",
			"\n",
			"Payoff externalities have a particular property here. When speculators face a coor-\n",
			"dination problem (e.g., attack a currency), there is some incentive to delay in order to\n",
			"obtain more information on others. There is also a premium, though, for the agents\n",
			"\n",
			"\f16.1 Speculative Attacks against a Fixed Exchange Rate\n",
			"\n",
			"361\n",
			"\n",
			"who invest earlier when the asset price is still relatively low. If the agent delays too\n",
			"long, he may come too late for the gain of the attack and may not get anything.\n",
			"\n",
			"The present model is built on a standard structure of a \ufb01nancial market with noise\n",
			"traders. The main feature of the model is that speculators observe the exchange rate\n",
			"at the end of each period and place market orders for the next period. Following\n",
			"Hellwig (1982) and Blume, Easley, and O\u2019Hara (1994), these orders depend on all the\n",
			"information available at the time they are placed and the rational expectations about\n",
			"the price in the next period. Speculators may delay the timing of their attack. An\n",
			"equilibrium is constructed analytically for any \ufb01nite number of periods by backward\n",
			"induction.\n",
			"\n",
			"In all periods, the subgame has an equilibrium in which there is no speculation for\n",
			"all remaining periods. Under some conditions on the beliefs of the agents, there are\n",
			"other equilibria with speculative attacks, as analyzed2 in Section 16.1.2. The purpose\n",
			"of the analysis is not to construct a model with a unique equilibrium in which there\n",
			"may be a speculative attack, but to analyze how a speculative attack may be facilitated\n",
			"by the learning from prices in markets, and how such equilibria with a speculative\n",
			"attack can be prevented by policy. Some properties of the model are illustrated by a\n",
			"numerical example with Gaussian noise.\n",
			"\n",
			"Policies are analyzed in the last section. The central bank can prevent a speculative\n",
			"attack by widening the band of \ufb02uctuations or through trading. If the central bank in-\n",
			"tervenes by stabilizing the exchange rate ( i.e., selling when the exchange rate increases)\n",
			"and this policy is anticipated by rational speculators, a speculative attack is more likely.\n",
			"Speculative attacks may be prevented either by a rationally anticipated intervention\n",
			"that ampli\ufb01es the \ufb02uctuations of the exchange rate or by a random intervention that\n",
			"cannot be anticipated.\n",
			"\n",
			"16.1.1 The Model\n",
			"There are a \ufb01nite number of periods, T + 1, and a continuum3 of speculators, called\n",
			"agents, of mass \u03b8 \u2208 {\u03b80, \u03b81}. The value of \u03b8 determines the state that is selected by\n",
			"nature before the \ufb01rst period. In each period, an agent can hold at most one unit of\n",
			"foreign currency, also called the asset. This constraint embodies a credit constraint. At\n",
			"the beginning of the \ufb01rst period, all agents hold only the domestic currency, also called\n",
			"simply the currency. In period T + 1, all agents undo their position: by assumption,\n",
			"all agents must hold only the currency at the end of period T + 1; if an agent holds\n",
			"the asset at the beginning of period T + 1, he sells it in period T + 1. The game is\n",
			"actually played during T periods.\n",
			"\n",
			"2 More results are shown in Chamley (2003b): a larger number of periods extend the set of beliefs for\n",
			"which a speculative attack is an equilibrium (Proposition 1); the equilibrium strategy that is analyzed\n",
			"here tends to a stationary solution when the number of periods tends to in\ufb01nity (Proposition 2).\n",
			"\n",
			"3 Dynamic speculative attacks with pivotal agents are analyzed in Rodionova and Surti (1999).\n",
			"\n",
			"\f362\n",
			"\n",
			"Financial Frenzies\n",
			"\n",
			"MARKET ORDERS\n",
			"At the beginning of any period, an agent who holds the currency can place a buy\n",
			"order for the asset, and an agent who holds the asset can place a sell order. The or-\n",
			"ders are market orders, i.e., they specify a quantity to be traded (conditional on no\n",
			"devaluation) for any market price in the period. An order depends on the informa-\n",
			"tion available at the beginning of the period and on the rational expectations, given\n",
			"that information, about the transaction price.4 Market orders embody the sequential\n",
			"nature of trades. Another assumption that is used in the microstructure of \ufb01nancial\n",
			"markets is that of limit orders. When agents can place limit orders, they submit their\n",
			"entire demand schedule contingent on the information revealed by the equilibrium\n",
			"price. Orders are executed only at the equilibrium price, and agents would not change\n",
			"their orders after the closing of the market even if they had an opportunity to do so.\n",
			"No rationing can occur. Such a setting is not appropriate for modeling a bank run\n",
			"or a situtation where agents would change their trade after the equilibrium price is\n",
			"known.\n",
			"\n",
			"We will consider only symmetric equilibria. Because agents are risk-neutral, the\n",
			"payoff for placing an order of amount (cid:22) < 1 for the asset will be equivalent to that\n",
			"for an order of 1 placed with probability (cid:22). We will assume the second formulation\n",
			"to facilitate the presentation. In this way, an agent either holds one unit of the asset\n",
			"(and is an asset holder) or holds no amount of the asset (and is a currency holder).\n",
			"\n",
			"THE MARKET FOR THE ASSET\n",
			"There is a game in period t if no devaluation (a process described below) has taken\n",
			"place before period t. Let \u03bbt\u22121 be the fraction of agents who hold the asset at the\n",
			"beginning of period t. The mass of agents who hold the asset at the beginning of\n",
			"period t is therefore \u03bbt\u22121\u03b8. By assumption, no agent holds the asset at the beginning\n",
			"of the \ufb01rst period: \u03bb0 = 0.\n",
			"\n",
			"We will consider only symmetric strategies: there is one strategy (possibly random)\n",
			"for the asset holders and one for the currency holders. Let \u03b6t be the fraction of agents\n",
			"who place a buy order for the asset in period t. By an abuse of notation, \u03b6t will\n",
			"also denote the strategy of currency holders who place a buy order with probability\n",
			"\u03b6t /(1 \u2212 \u03bbt\u22121). The strategy of the asset holders will be simpler, as we will see later: if\n",
			"some agents buy in an equilibrium, no asset holder sells, and if some asset holders sell,\n",
			"they all sell. Because there will thus be no ambiguity, \u201corder\u201d will mean a buy order.\n",
			"Suppose \u03b6t > 0. Given the quantity of orders \u03b6t \u03b8, the demand for the asset by the\n",
			"agents in period t (a stock) is (\u03bbt\u22121 + \u03b6t)\u03b8. The total demand for the asset in period\n",
			"t is the sum of the agents\u2019 endogenous demands and of an exogenous noise \u03b7t. The\n",

			"is stationary. The terms \u03b7t are serially independent, and the mean of \u03b7t is equal to zero.\n",
			"The supply of the asset is a linear function of its price p: S( p) = ( p \u2212 1)/a,\n",
			"where a is a \ufb01xed parameter. The value of S represents the net supply when the price\n",
			"departs from the middle of the band of exchange rate \ufb02uctuations, which can be\n",
			"interpreted as a long-run value as determined by real trade and policy. This long-run\n",
			"price is an equilibrium value when there is no speculative attack, and it is normalized\n",
			"to 1. The supply schedule S( p) can be de\ufb01ned as minus the net demand of risk-\n",
			"averse marketmakers who place price-contingent orders that may take into account\n",
			"the information revealed by the transaction price. Their net demand is of the form\n",
			"\u03ba(E [ pt+1| pt] \u2212 pt)/Var( pt+1| pt), where pt and pt+1 are the prices of the asset in\n",
			"periods t and t + 1, and \u03ba > 0 is a parameter. Because marketmakers attach a lower\n",
			"ex ante subjective probability to state \u03b81 than speculators, they interpret the market\n",
			"data differently. (The speculators are more optimistic about their high mass.) For\n",
			"simplicity, we assume that the marketmakers assign ex ante a vanishingly low proba-\n",
			"bility to there being a high mass of speculators and that a devaluation will take place.\n",
			"Hence, contingent on the observation of the equilibrium price, the revised probability\n",
			"of a devaluation is still vanishingly low: E [ pt+1| pt] = 1, and the variance of pt+1 in\n",
			"the subjective distribution is constant. In this case, their net demand is of the form\n",
			"(1 \u2212 p)/a with a = Var( pt+1| pt)/\u03ba. If the current price pt has a signi\ufb01cant effect on\n",
			"the expected value E [ pt+1| pt], a higher price pt shifts the demand curve up, and the\n",
			"effect is equivalent to that of a less elastic demand curve. We will consider below the\n",
			"effect of such a lower elasticity on the properties of the model.\n",
			"\n",
			"The schedule S( p) may also incorporate the strategy of other agents whose trades\n",
			"depend only on pt. The central bank is assumed to perform the function of a clear-\n",

			"WIDENING THE BAND OF FLUCTUATIONS\n",

			"to an increase in \u03b3 . In the present model, if \u03b3 = A, there is no capital gain if a de-\n",
			"valuation takes place, hence no expected pro\ufb01t. If the attack fails, however, there is\n",
			"a capital loss. Hence, there is no speculative attack in an equilibrium. By continuity,\n",
			"that property holds if \u03b3 \u2217 < \u03b3 \u2264 A for some \u03b3 \u2217\n",
			"(0 < \u03b3 \u2217 < A). A speculative attack\n",
			"can be prevented by a suitable widening of the band of \ufb02uctuations.\n",
			"\n",
			"A relevant episode occurred at the end of July 1993 with the speculative attack\n",
			"against the French franc, which was part of the ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism).\n",
			"The regime had margins of 2.25 percent on each side of a reference level. After trying\n",
			"unsuccessfully to ward off the speculators through trading, the central banks of the\n",
			"monetary union raised the bands of \ufb02uctuations to 15 percent. The change of regime\n",
			"stopped the attack,13 as illustrated in Figure 1 of Obstfeld (1996).\n",
			"\n",
			"STABILIZING THE EXCHANGE RATE THROUGH TRADE INTERVENTION\n",
			"There are two types of trade interventions by the central bank, those that are deter-\n",
			"ministic and predictable, and those that are random and surprise the speculators. A\n",
			"trade policy that is determined by the exchange rate is predictable by rational agents.\n",
			"As an example, assume that the central bank supplies a quantity of foreign currency\n",
			"according to the linear rule\n",

			"\n",
			"with b > 0.\n",
			"\n",
			"(16.12)\n",
			"\n",
			"With b > 0, the central bank attempts to reduce the \ufb02uctuations of the exchange\n",
			"rate. Such a policy requires a positive level of reserves R. The problem of defense\n",
			"is interesting only if the reserves cannot prevent a speculative attack under perfect\n",
			"information, i.e., if R < \u03b81 \u2212 X (as in Obstfeld, 1996). Such a constraint imposes a\n",
			"restriction on the stabilization policy. Because SB \u2264 R for all values of p < 1 + \u03b3 ,\n",
			"we must have b \u2264 R/\u03b3 .\n",
			"\n",
			"Speculators with rational expectations anticipate the policy. We assume accord-\n",

			"13 The last exchange rate between the Deutsche mark and the French franc before the change of\n",

			"increased to 3.5080; it then fell to 3.46040 two days later. It then began to increase again and to\n",
			"hover around 3.50. However, by that time the information had probably changed. Agents expected\n",
			"the interest rate to be lowered in France to take advantage of the greater exchange rate \ufb02exibility\n",
			"and reduce unemployment. Eventually, the expectations were seen to be mistaken: such a policy\n",
			"was not conducted by the central bank. After hovering between 3.48 and 3.55 until the beginning\n",
			"of December, the exchange rate decreased steadily during the last month of the year to end at 3.40.\n",
			"In agreement with the policy interpretation in this chapter, after the exchange rate returned to its\n",
			"midband level, the central banks felt no need to reduce the bands back to the original 2.25 percent.\n",
			"The wider band contributed to the stabilization of the exchange rate. (For a discussion of the events\n",

			"the domain of beliefs in which a speculative attack may take place. In the present\n",
			"model, a central bank that reduces the \ufb02uctuations of the exchange rate does not alter\n",
			"the functioning of the exchange rate as a coordination device, but it reduces the risk\n",

			"\n",
			"RANDOM INTERVENTION\n",
			"Trades by the central bank that cannot be predicted by speculators have to be ran-\n",

			"distributed N (0, \u03c3R) and set before the opening of the market. Rational speculators\n",
			"know the parameter \u03c3R but cannot observe R. The random trading by the central bank\n",
			"adds noise and thus reduces the information content of the price in the \ufb01rst period.\n",
			"Numerical simulations show that the smaller information reduces the possibility of\n",
			"coordination between speculators.\n",
			"In the example of Figure 16.1, the speculative attack is eliminated when \u03c3R \u2265\n",
			"0.06X. For a policy of random interventions, some reserves are required (because the\n",
			"foreign currency does have to be sold at times), contrary to the policy of determin-\n",
			"istic trade. However, these reserves may be signi\ufb01cantly smaller than what would be\n",
			"required under perfect information. This is an important implication of the present\n",
			"model for policy. By trading in a nonpredictable manner, the central bank can pre-\n",
			"vent speculators from coordinating an attack. The amount of reserves required for\n",
			"this policy can be smaller than what would be required if speculators had complete\n",
			"information on their total resources.14\n",
			"\n",
			"THE INTEREST RATE\n",
			"Raising the interest rate is a standard defense policy. Numerical simulations (in\n",
			"Chamley, 2003b) show that this policy is effective in the context of the model. For the\n",
			"parameters of Figure 16.1, an increase of the interest rate from 0.15 to 0.25 percent de-\n",
			"fends the regime. The policy is effective because it raises the cost of \u201ccommunication\u201d\n",
			"through the price at the beginning of an attack.15\n",
			"\n",
			"14 In the example of Figure 16.1, the central bank needs a level of reserves equal to R = 0.12X. (The\n",
			"normal distribution can be considered as an approximation of a distribution where the trade by the\n",
			"central bank is bounded.) If all speculators have knowledge of the high state and attack, the central\n",
			"bank\u2019s reserves R are too low to fend off the attack: \u03b81 \u2212 X = 0.3X > R.\n",
			"\n",
			"15 If the parameters of the model and the beliefs are such that there is an attack by all speculators\n",

			"16.3 The Crash of a Bubble\n",
			"\n",
			"A bubble occurs when an asset that yields no real dividend has a positive price. The\n",
			"equilibrium price is positive because agents expect it to appreciate, on average. Under\n",
			"reasonable conditions, however, the price is subject to an upper bound. When the\n",
			"price reaches the upper bound (an event that must occur in \ufb01nite time), no further\n",
			"appreciation is possible and the high price is not sustainable in an equilibrium. It\n",
			"is therefore not sustainable in the previous period, and, by backward induction, in\n",
			"any period, including the \ufb01rst one. This argument, stated informally, is the main one\n",
			"against the existence of bubbles with rational agents.\n",
			"\n",
			"An examination of famous bubbles in the past shows that they always originated\n",
			"with some genuine good news. The spectacular rise of the price of John Law\u2019s company\n",
			"in 1719 was supported by some real events: he gained control of all tax collections,\n",
			"all foreign trade, and the central bank. The critical issue is the transition from a\n",
			"fundamental rise of the price to a bubble. During the recent boom of new technology\n",
			"stocks, no one questioned the emergence of new opportunities. The concern was\n",
			"about the magnitude of these opportunities. For some, the Dow should have risen to\n",
			"30,000; for others, the market was already much above the value of the fundamentals.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f16.3 The Crash of a Bubble\n",
			"\n",
			"379\n",
			"\n",
			"In other terms, a critical issue is the lack of common knowledge about the onset of a\n",
			"price rise that is not due to fundamentals.\n",
			"\n",
			"The lack of common knowledge about the timing of the beginning of a bubble is\n",
			"the central problem in the paper by Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003). Removing the\n",
			"common knowledge and introducing some simplifying assumptions, they show how\n",
			"a bubble may occur although all agents know that a crash will eventually take place.\n",
			"Their model is also a contribution to the analysis of social interactions when there is\n",
			"no common knowledge about the \u201c\ufb01rst period.\u201d\n",
			"\n",
			"THE MODEL\n",
			"An asset has a fundamental price, which grows at the rate g in a \ufb01rst interval of time\n",
			"[0, \u03b8]; after time \u03b8, the price grows at the rate of the market r < g . The \ufb01rst phase can\n",
			"be justi\ufb01ed by the gradual arrival of good news about the future pro\ufb01ts generated by\n",
			"the asset.20 The realization of \u03b8 is random and is distributed according to a Poisson\n",
			"process with parameter \u03bb per unit of time. Agents do not observe \u03b8 perfectly. After time\n",
			"\u03b8 the price continues to rise at the pre-\u03b8 rate g , which is higher than the fundamental\n",
			"rate r , unless a crash occurs, as will be de\ufb01ned below. If a crash takes place at time t,\n",
			"the price drops, by assumption, to the fundamental price at time t. Let p(t) be the\n",
			"bubble price at time t > \u03b8: p(t) = p(\u03b8)e g (t\u2212\u03b8). Because the fundamental price at time\n",
			"t is p(\u03b8)er (t\u2212\u03b8) when a crash takes place, the price loses a fraction \u03b2(t \u2212 \u03b8) of its value\n",
			"with\n",

			"\n",
			"\u2212(g\u2212r )(t\u2212\u03b8).\n",
			"\n",
			"There is no microeconomic foundation of the market that determines the price of\n",
			"the asset. The price depends on the actions of agents as follows. The asset is held at\n",
			"the beginning of time by a continuum of agents of mass one. Each agent holds a \ufb01xed\n",
			"amount of the asset, which can be normalized to one (as in the model of speculative\n",
			"attacks, Section 16.1). An agent can trade between the asset and the market (which\n",
			"earns the rate r ) at any time. The present discussion is simpli\ufb01ed, with no loss of\n",
			"substance, by assuming that the strategy of the agent is about the timing of the sale\n",
			"of his holding.\n",
			"\n",
			"An essential purpose of the model is to represent the gradual acquisition of private\n",
			"information and the absence of common knowledge. At the time \u03b8 when the phase\n",
			"of above-market growth stops, a constant \ufb02ow of information begins: the mass of\n",
			"informed agents at time t > \u03b8 is (t \u2212 \u03b8)/\u03c3 . When an agent becomes informed at\n",
			"time t, he learns that the market price is above the fundamental, i.e., \u03b8 < t. For\n",
			"simplicity, the \ufb02ow of newly informed agents is taken as constant at the rate of 1/\u03c3\n",
			"per unit of time, until all the agents are informed, at time \u03b8 + \u03c3 . This generating\n",

			"Let us consider the exogenous crash, which contains the main features of the model.\n",
			"The bubble ends with a crash, and the price returns to the fundamental, with proba-\n",
			"bility 1. The model seems to solve the problem of backward induction when a crash\n",
			"must take place. However, a careful examination shows that this is not the case.\n",
			"\n",
			"The standard argument against bubbles with rational agents is that the ratio be-\n",
			"tween the bubble price and a variable that grows with the economy must be subject to\n",
			"an upper bound. Suppose that the economy is growing at the rate n < r (on an ef\ufb01-\n",
			"cient path), and that there is an arbitrarily large value A such that p0e g t < Ae nt. Such\n",
			"a property contradicts the assumptions of the model of Abreu and Brunnermeier: the\n",
			"inequality implies that a crash must occur no later than T such that p0e g T = Ae nT ,\n",
			"and this property is common knowledge. An essential feature in the model is that the\n",
			"growth rate of the bubble price is strictly22 higher than r + \u03b1, where \u03b1 > 0.\n",
			"\n",
			"The answer to the bubble problem by Abreu and Brunnermeier is not different,\n",
			"essentially, from that by Blanchard (1979). In the model of Blanchard, the bubble\n",
			"returns to the fundamental through a crash, which occurs in a Poisson process. The\n",
			"end of the bubble occurs with probability 1. As long as the bubble goes on, the growth\n",
			"rate is above the rate of return of the market. The argument requires that no upper\n",
			"bound exist on the bubble price. In the model of Blanchard, the growth rate of the\n",
			"bubble price must be higher than the market rate to compensate for the probability\n",
			"of the crash, as all agents are informed. In the model of Abreu and Brunnermeier, the\n",
			"growth rate of the bubble price does not need to be as high, because only a fraction\n",
			"of the agents are informed.\n",
			"\n",
			"22 If one admits that g decreases over time and g \u2192 r , the holding length of time tends to 0. If agents\n",
			"sell as soon as they are informed, the equilibrium is trivial: agents hold the asset only while they are\n",

			"\n",
			"To get a feeling for this, let us reconsider the study of Coleman, Katz, and Menzel\n",
			"[154] discussed in Section ??. Van den Bulte and Lilien [600] criticize the study saying\n",
			"that it did not properly account for the e\u2044ects that marketing and advertizing e\u2044orts\n",

			"\n",
			"563\n",
			"\n",
			"controlling for marketing and other characteristics. Nevertheless, the point that one\n",
			"needs to include all the relevant factors in the analysis is an important one.\n",
			"\n",
			"As a very simple example, suppose that degree in a network is correlated with age,\n",
			"so that older people have more connections. Now suppose that one hypothesizes that\n",

			"\n",

			"then when we (cid:133)t (13.1), given (13.2), we can end up seeing an estimate for the coe\u00a2 cient\n",
			"on degree, (cid:12)d, that looks signi(cid:133)cant, but is really just a proxy for the e\u2044ect of age,\n",
			"which is (cid:133)ltered through degree.\n",
			"\n",
			"Suppose instead that the true relationship is of the form\n",

			"Yi = (cid:11)d + (cid:12)ddi + (cid:12)aagei + \"i;\n",
			"\n",
			"(13.4)\n",
			"\n",
			"so that both degree and age a\u2044ect the variable in question. For example, suppose that\n",
			"we are examining a model of social capital, and so Yi is some measure of wealth or\n",
			"power accumulation, and we are testing for how this is in(cid:135)uenced by a measure of\n",
			"social connectedness. If we then (cid:133)t (13.1), including degree but omitting age, then\n",
			"given that degree and age are related according to (13.2), we will end up with a biased\n",
			"estimate of (cid:12)d as it proxies for some of the e\u2044ect of age. For instance, with positive\n",
			"relationships between each of the variables, by omitting age we would end up with an\n",
			"in(cid:135)ated estimate of how degree a\u2044ects wealth.\n",
			"\n",
			"While such speci(cid:133)cation and omitted variable problems are not unique to analysis\n",

			"Instrumental Variables\n",
			"\n",
			"It is generally di\u00a2 cult to be sure of all of the potential factors that might covary with\n",

			"omitted variables and other sorts of misspeci(cid:133)cations in estimating the impact of social\n",
			"structure on behavior. One way to view the bias that emerges in estimation is that the\n",
			"omission or misspeci(cid:133)cation leads the variables that we wish to estimate e\u2044ects of to\n",
			"be correlated with the error term, and that can result in the bias in estimation (and\n",
			"can lead the estimator to be inconsistent so that even large data sets will not overcome\n",
			"the problem).\n",
			"\n",
			"A standard approach to dealing with such problems is to work with instrumental\n",
			"variables. To develop an intuitive understanding of instrumental variable methods, let\n",
			"us understand what goes wrong in the case of an omitted variable. Ideally, to estimate\n",
			"the e\u2044ect of degree on wealth, we would like to have a set of observations where degree\n",
			"is varied, and other variables are held constant in order to isolate the marginal e\u2044ect of\n",
			"degree on wealth. If we design controlled experiment, this is how we would set things\n",
			"up. The di\u00a2 culty is that we do not have such control, and when degree is high, the\n",
			"omitted variable of age also tends to be high, and when degree is low, the omitted\n",
			"variable of age also tends to be low. The idea of an instrumental variable is that it\n",
			"is one that is correlated with degree, but uncorrelated with the error term, or in this\n",
			"case, uncorrelated with the omitted variable of age. If we (cid:133)nd a variable that covaries\n",
			"with degree, but is uncorrelated with the error term (and in this case with the omitted\n",
			"variables), then that serves as a substitute for the controlled experiment that we would\n",
			"have liked to design. For example, we might (cid:133)nd some sort of factor that leads to\n",
			"changes in degree, such as a club that opens branches in some communities but not\n",
			"others (for exogenous reasons), but in a way that we expect to be uncorrelated with\n",
			"things like age or anything else that might lead to correlation with the error or omitted\n",
			"variables. This variable becomes the instrument. E\u2044ectively, it provides the sort of\n",
			"experiment that we would have liked to have set up, but causing variation in degree in\n",
			"ways that are independent of other possible explanatory factors.\n",
			"\n",
			"One can then derive estimates based on the instruments using standard techniques\n",
			"\n",
			"\f13.1. SPECIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n",
			"\n",
			"565\n",
			"\n",
			"developed for this purpose or we can use two-stage least squares estimation. That\n",
			"is, we (cid:133)rst regress degree on the instrumental variable, to develop estimated values of\n",
			"degree based on the instrument. Then in the place of degree in the original regression\n",
			"we use these estimated values of degree as predicted by the instrument, which are then\n",
			"independent of the error terms as they are conditional on the instrument. In this way\n",
			"we obtain a consistent estimator.\n",
			"\n",
			"Endogeneity\n",
			"\n",
			"Another problem that arises in working with estimation based on social structure is\n",
			"that social structure is often endogenous to the things that it impacts. For example, in\n",
			"estimating the impact of social connectedness on wealth, it could also be that wealth\n",
			"impacts connectedness; e.g., by providing additional access or opportunities.1 While\n",
			"this is a distinct problem from the speci(cid:133)cation and omitted variables problem discussed\n",
			"above, it could also lead degree to be correlated with the error term, and can also lead\n",
			"to biased and inconsistent estimation.\n",
			"\n",
			"Instrumental variables can also be helpful in sorting out endogeneity issues. Again,\n",
			"we want an instrumental variable that is related to degree, but will not be related to\n",
			"the error terms. Thus, it is a variable that avoids being endogenous, but is related to\n",
			"degree, and so when it leads to high or low degree we are sure that the high or low\n",
			"degree is coming about for exogenous reasons. For example, if a government came in\n",
			"and randomly chooses some villages to provide subsidized communication to (in the\n",
			"form of internet or telephone, etc.) which might enhance degree in some villages and\n",
			"not others, then we could examine how these changes in degree for exogenous reasons\n",
			"in(cid:135)uence wealth. More speci(cid:133)cally, we could measure the induced degree di\u2044erences\n",
			"that we attribute to the government program and then see the extent to which it\n",
			"in(cid:135)uences wealth, again using two-stage least squares, or other methods of working\n",
			"with instrumental variables.\n",
			"\n",
			"While instrumental variables are a very useful tool for dealing with the omitted\n",
			"variable and endogeneity problems, they are not a panacea. First, (cid:133)nding (cid:147)good(cid:148)\n",
			"instruments, that are related to the problematic variable(s), but are not endogenous\n",
			"and not related to omitted variables and error terms, can be problematic. In fact, we\n",
			"can never really be sure of this as we never directly observe the (cid:147)true(cid:148) error terms.\n",

			"challenging as there can still be omitted variables that are at the root of adoption.\n",

			"It is important to note that taking advantage of timing has been used not only\n",
			"to uncover whether an agent(cid:146)s behavior is in(cid:135)uenced by his or her peers and social\n",
			"neighbors, but also to examine the endogeneity of social structure. For example is it\n",
			"that an agent acts in a certain way because his or her friends do, or is it that he or\n",
			"she selects friends that act in similar ways? This sort of endogeneity question is funda-\n",
			"mental to social network analysis, especially when examining peer e\u2044ects, and timing\n",
			"can be used to help sort out these e\u2044ects. For example, Kandel [?] uses time series\n",
			"data on high school friendships together with data on individual drug use, delinquency,\n",
			"political opinion, and educational aspirations, to examine whether friendships tend to\n",
			"form among agents with similar behaviors, or whether agents(cid:146)behaviors are in(cid:135)uenced\n",
			"by that of their friends.7 By examining the formation of new friendships and the dete-\n",
			"rioration of old friendships together with behavior over time, Kandel is able to identify\n",
			"whether either or both of these e\u2044ects are present. The timing helps her show that\n",
			"both e\u2044ects are present. Agents are relatively more likely to form new friendships with\n",
			"others whose past behavior matches their own, and to sever past friendships with others\n",
			"whose past behavior di\u2044ers from theirs. In addition, when agents(cid:146)behaviors change,\n",
			"it tends to be in(cid:135)uenced by the past behavior of the agents who remain their friends.\n",
			"Moreover, the magnitude of the e\u2044ects di\u2044ers across behaviors. Such an analysis is\n",
			"demanding in terms of the richness of the data that is necessary, especially if one also\n",
			"wants to control for other variables which might be adjusting over time and co-varying\n",
			"with behavior and or social structure. Nevertheless, longitudinal (time series) data is\n",

			"As we have seen in the previous sections, many of the challenges in empirical analysis\n",

			"how social structure a\u2044ects behavior, and how an agent(cid:146)s position within a network\n",
			"in(cid:135)uences his or her behavior. For example, one can put agents in speci(cid:133)c network\n",
			"contexts, such as in an exchange or bargaining network in the experiments of Cook and\n",
			"Emerson [161] and Charness, Corominas-Bosch, and Frechette [135]. Then comparing\n",
			"behavior across network position, as well as tracking changes in behavior as one changes\n",
			"overall network structure, allows one to explicitly track the impact of social network\n",
			"structure on behavior. There the idea is that the only variable that is altered is\n",
			"the social structure, which helps show whether or not agents behave di\u2044erently when\n",
			"embedded in di\u2044erent positions within a network or in di\u2044erent networks. One can\n",
			"also examine something like how well agents are able to communicate and learn in\n",
			"social contexts, and how that depends on the network structure (e.g., see Bavelas [44],\n",
			"Leavitt [405], Choi, Gale and Kariv [141]), or how well agents are able to coordinate\n",
			"their actions in a social network (e.g., see Kearns, Suri, Montfort [365]). One can also\n",
			"investigate whether or not agents will behave di\u2044erently if the network that they are\n",
			"part of is exogenously imposed or chosen by them (see Corbae and Du\u2044y [165] and\n",
			"Riedl and Ule [?]). The control present in the experimental setting has proven to be a\n",
			"very useful tool for identifying network e\u2044ects.\n",
			"\n",
			"Second, one can test alternative theories of behavior in network contexts. Here one\n",
			"does not necessarily need to use variations in treatments within an experiment; instead\n",
			"one can simply (cid:133)nd a setting where the predictions of di\u2044erent theories lead to di\u2044erent\n",
			"outcomes. For example, one can test models of network formation such as (cid:147)myopic(cid:148)\n",
			"ones like pairwise stability against a (cid:147)farsighted(cid:148)notion, as in Pantz and Ziegelmeyer\n",
			"[497]. There, the payo\u2044s to network formation can be (cid:133)xed, but are chosen by the\n",
			"experimenter so that one should observe di\u2044erent networks form if agents are farsighted\n",
			"in their link formation rather than myopic. Alternatively, one does not necessarily have\n",
			"to run a horse race of di\u2044erent theories against each other, but one can simply test\n",
			"whether a given theory(cid:146)s predictions hold. For example, one can examine variations\n",
			"on undirected or directed connections model and then see whether pairwise stable or\n",
			"nash stable networks form (e.g., see Callander and Plott [112], Falk and Kosfeld [224],\n",

			"\n",
			"While the (cid:133)rst approach above was useful because it allows one to adjust some\n",
			"aspect of the social setting and then isolate its a\u2044ect on outcomes, the advantage\n",
			"of the second approach is di\u2044erent. Under the second approach one only needs a\n",

			"\n",
			"Beyond laboratory experiments, (cid:133)eld experiments can be a very useful tool as well.\n",
			"One loses some of the control of a laboratory environment, but gains access to a social\n",

			"13.2.1 Communities and Blocks\n",

			"There are various ways in which the structure underlying a social network can be mod-\n",

			"\n",
			"One notion of a block or community is that it consists of nodes that are somehow\n",

			"\n",
			"Start with an observed social network described by an adjacency matrix g, which\n",
			"can be either directed or undirected. Two nodes are thought of as being similar if they\n",
			"have a similar pattern of relationships with other nodes. One way to gauge how similar\n",
			"node i is to node j in terms of the network of relationships is to examine how similar\n",
			"row (gi1; : : : ; gin) is to row (gj1; : : : ; gjn).14 A measure of how similar these rows are to\n",

			"\n",
			"The CONCOR algorithm does not stop here. This (cid:133)rst step leads to a correlation\n",
			"matrix C, where cij is the correlation between row gi and row gj of the adjacency\n",
			"matrix. Next, let us measure how similar row i of the correlation matrix C is to row\n",
			"j, via the same method. If nodes i and j are similar, then they should have similar\n",
			"rows of correlations with other nodes. So, the algorithm then measures the correlation\n",
			"between rows ci and cj of the correlation matrix. In this way, we form a new correlation\n",
			"matrix C (2). Iterating, the algorithm generates a matrix of correlations of correlations\n",
			"\n",
			"12To varying extents, the same criticism can be made of many measures in social network analysis.\n",
			"For example, there is much still to be learned about what di\u2044erent measures of centrality, prestige,\n",

			"Repeated Bisection\n",
			"\n",
			"CONCOR is a method that repeatedly bisects the set of nodes based on a speci(cid:133)c\n",
			"technique of grouping nodes. There are other methods, which developed out of the\n",
			"computer science literature, that also work by repeated bisection. For example, a\n",
			"quite simple principle is to simply start by bisecting the set of nodes into two groups\n",
			"such that there is a minimal number of links between the two groups, with some rule\n",
			"based on what to do in the case where more than one bisection leads to the same\n",
			"minimum. Then one can repeat the procedure on the emergent groups. Again, using\n",
			"some stopping rule, one ends up with a community structure.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are many variations on this basic idea. Instead of minimizing the number of\n",
			"links between the two groups, one might try to maximize some measure of how many\n",
			"links exist within each group, less how many go across the groups (e.g., see Kernighan\n",
			"and Lin [368]). Or, one might rely on more sophisticated methods where one examines\n",
			"the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix or an associated Laplacian matrix (e.g., see\n",
			"Fiedler [230] and Pothen, Simon and Liou [520]).18\n",
			"\n",
			"Beyond the question of the how one measures how good a bisection is, there is\n",
			"also a question of whether one searches over all possible bisections or limits attention\n",
			"to certain types of bisections. For example one can pre-specify the sizes of the two\n",
			"sets of nodes. For example, one might only consider bisections into equal (or nearly\n",
			"equal) sized sets of nodes. This is not a minor technicality, as it can lead to a sizeable\n",
			"di\u2044erence in the number of potential bisections that one needs to consider. Also, many\n",
			"of these methods would tend to bisect the network very asymmetrically if no constraints\n",
			"are imposed, since, for instance, minimizing the links between groups might be found\n",
			"by identifying a single node with low degree and separating that from the rest of the\n",
			"network, and it is not clear that this would be sensible. This relates back to the earlier\n",
			"criticism that we are not quite sure what we are looking for, and so the answer to this\n",
			"question is not tied down.\n",

			"In addition to measuring the optimality of a bisection, and which bisections to\n",

			"consider, there is the stopping decision which we saw can be somewhat arbitrary.\n",
			"Finally, one can also move beyond bisections. For example, one can start with the\n",
			"problem of splitting the set of nodes into some number of (nearly) equal sized groups\n",
			"in a way that minimizes the links across groups and/or maximizes the number of links\n",
			"within groups.\n",
			"\n",
			"Edge Removal\n",
			"\n",
			"One method that avoids the issue of predetermining the sizes of the groups to bisect a\n",
			"network into, instead works by repeatedly removing edges of the network and keeping\n",
			"track of the component structure of the resulting graph to determine a community\n",
			"structure. Such a method, developed by Girvan and Newman [271], iteratively removes\n",
			"edges by calculating the betweenness of each link and then removing the link that has\n",
			"maximum betweenness. The logic is that if a link has a very high betweenness score,\n",
			"then it is connecting (at least) two groups of nodes that otherwise are quite separate.\n",
			"These groups would then be natural candidates to be separate communities of nodes.\n",
			"This process can be done in various ways, depending on the notion of betweenness\n",
			"used.\n",
			"\n",
			"Let us demonstrate this technique on the example from Figure 13.2.1, using the\n",
			"easy-to-calculate measure of the betweenness of a link that Girvan and Newman use (a\n",
			"variation on Freeman(cid:146)s notion discussed in Section [?]), which is the number shortest\n",
			"paths between pairs of nodes in the network that involve the link in question. That is,\n",
			"for each link we count the total number of geodesics in the network that include that\n",
			"link. The link with the highest count is the one we remove. (It could be that a pair\n",
			"of nodes has more than one shortest path that involves the same link. For example,\n",
			"nodes 8 and 5 have two shortest paths between them that involve the link 56.) Once\n",
			"a link is removed, one repeats the process on the resulting subgraph, calculating new\n",
			"betweenness scores at each step.\n",
			"\n",
			"Figure 13.2.2 shows the resulting community structure under this algorithm if one\n",
			"stops when the betweenness of an edge reaches 2 (so that the highest betweenness\n",
			"measure of any link remaining in the network is 2; see Exercise 13.3 for the precise\n",
			"steps).\n",
			"\n",
			"The calculations involved in order to run the Girvan and Newman algorithm can\n",
			"become extensive as the number of nodes grows, as the betweenness measures involve\n",
			"(cid:133)nding all shortest paths through a given link.\n",
			"In view of this, there are various\n",
			"alternative measures and algorithms that have been developed (see Newman [483] for\n",

			"\n",
			"This algorithm runs into the same issue that we saw with bisection methods: when\n",
			"to stop. Newman and Girvan [484] propose a method for determining when to stop this\n",
			"(or another) algorithm. For any community structure (cid:5), one can calculate the following\n",
			"measure that Newman and Girvan call modularity. For two communities (cid:25) 2 (cid:5) and\n",
			"(cid:25)0 2 (cid:5) let e(cid:25)(cid:25)0(g) denote the fraction of all edges in the network that connect nodes in\n",

			"Modularity measures the proportion of edges that lie within communities minus the\n",
			"expected value of the same quantity in a graph such that all nodes have the same\n",

			"When this measure is 0, then the communities are not capturing much of anything. If\n",
			"the measure is positive, then the communities are capturing more of a fraction of links\n",

			"across communities and fewer within than one would see at random. So, the idea is\n",
			"to maximize this modularity measure, and a rule for stopping an algorithm is that one\n",
			"stops if the modularity decreases by further edge removal. One has to be careful, as\n",
			"there can be local maximizers that are not global maximizers, and so one technique\n",

			"and breaking it apart. This methodology underlies a whole class of algorithms, called\n",
			"(cid:147)hierarchical clustering(cid:148)methods.\n",
			"\n",
			"The ideas are as follows. The foundation is to have some measure of how similar\n",
			"two nodes are based on a given network. There are many such measures. One could\n",
			"use the correlation coe\u00a2 cients between the rows of the adjacency matrix, C (1), which\n",
			"was the (cid:133)rst step of the CONCOR process above.\n",
			"Instead, we could calculate the\n",
			"distance between the vectors gi and gj (using Euclidean distance; or city-block distance\n",
			"- the number of entries that di\u2044er across the two vectors). We could also use various\n",
			"measures built on path distances or other indications of how the roles of two nodes\n",
			"within the network compare. The important point is that there is some measure that\n",
			"the analyst believes captures the appropriate notion of how similar two nodes are in\n",
			"the given application.\n",
			"\n",
			"For the purpose of illustration, let us measure similarity between nodes i and j, via\n",
			"a slight variation19 on the city block distance between rows, or in particular set the\n",
			"distance between nodes i and j to be\n",
			"\n",
			"bij(g) = #fkjgik 6= gjk; k 6= i; k 6= jg:\n",
			"\n",

			"indicates the number of other nodes k with whom i and j di\u2044er in their relationships.\n",
			"So it directly counts the di\u2044erences between the neighborhoods of nodes i and j.\n",

			"In order to use the distance information to construct a community structure, let us\n",

			"two nodes together that have bij(g) = 0. Thus, a link between two nodes indicates that\n",
			"we think they are (cid:147)similar(cid:148) in that they are at a low distance from each other. If we\n",
			"stop here, then we end up with a community structure that is the partition induced by\n",
			"the components of this network, g(0).20 As there may not be many pairs of nodes that\n",
			"are structurally equivalent, g(0) will tend to have very few links, and so we usually end\n",
			"up with a very sparse community structure with many small communities if we stop\n",
			"with a threshold of 0. This suggests raising the threshold for how distant nodes can be\n",
			"from each other and be linked - or considered (cid:147)similar(cid:148). If we set a threshold t, then\n",

			"g(t) = fijjbij(g) (cid:20) tg:\n",
			"\n",
			"As we raise the threshold, the components of the induced graph continue to grow as\n",

			"\n",
			"Consider the following fundamental scenario where networks play a central role. There\n",
			"is a society of individuals whose relationships are described by a network, indicating\n",
			"who has contact with whom on a regular basis. This might be a network of email,\n",
			"friendships, acquaintances, or even things like sexual relationships or some sort of\n",
			"blood to blood contacts. To keep things simple at this point, let us presume that\n",
			"individuals are either linked or not, so that we abstract away from the fact that some\n",
			"relationships might involve greater or more frequent interaction than others. Now,\n",
			"consider the introduction of a disease. Individuals can catch the virus if they interact\n",
			"with one of their neighbors who is infected with the disease. This happens somewhat\n",
			"randomly, as the chance of interaction might be random and it might also take speci(cid:133)c\n",
			"conditions for the disease to be transmitted. Let us also suppose that the chance of\n",
			"a given healthy individual becoming infected increases with the number of neighbors\n",
			"who are infected. Under what conditions will an initial outbreak spread to a nontrivial\n",
			"portion of the population? What percent of the population will eventually become\n",
			"infected? How does this depend on the network of contacts in the society? How does\n",
			"it depend on the contagion probabilities and recovery rates? What if a number of\n",
			"individuals are immune to the disease, or require di\u2044erent frequencies of interaction to\n",
			"be infected? How would immunizing the population a\u2044ect the spread of the disease?\n",
			"This is a problem of obvious importance. Beyond the direct application to disease\n",
			"transmission, we can also see that this is closely related to the di\u2044usion through a net-\n",

			"can be very important in determining the outcome. If there are relatively few contacts\n",
			"between individuals, then the disease might never spread. If some pockets of the soci-\n",
			"ety are isolated from others, they might remain relatively uninfected (or uninformed,\n",

			"\n",
			"7.1 Background: The Bass Model\n",
			"\n",
			"An early model of di\u2044usions (that is still a workhorse) is the Bass [?] model. The model\n",
			"is lean and tractable and incorporates social aspects into its structure. Although it\n",
			"does not have any explicit social network structure, it still incorporates imitation. The\n",
			"model is built on two key parameters: one captures the rate at which agents innovate or\n",
			"spontaneously adopt, and the other captures the rate at which they imitate other agents\n",
			"or adopt because others have.3 One can also interpret the innovation as a response to\n",
			"outside stimuli, like media or advertising, while the imitation aspect captures social\n",
			"and peer e\u2044ects.\n",
			"\n",
			"Consider discrete time periods t and let F (t) be the fraction of agents in a society\n",
			"who have adopted a new product or behavior by time t. The Bass model is then\n",
			"described by a di\u2044erence equation which takes the form\n",
			"\n",
			"F (t) = F (t (cid:0) 1) + p (1 (cid:0) F (t (cid:0) 1)) + q (1 (cid:0) F (t (cid:0) 1)) F (t (cid:0) 1);\n",
			"\n",
			"where p is a rate of innovation and q is a rate of imitation. The expression p (1 (cid:0) F (t (cid:0) 1))\n",
			"is the rate of innovation times the fraction of people who have not yet adopted. The\n",
			"expression q (1 (cid:0) F (t (cid:0) 1)) F (t (cid:0) 1) captures the imitation process where the rate of\n",
			"imitation is multiplied by two factors. The (cid:133)rst factor, (m (cid:0) F (t (cid:0) 1)), is again the\n",
			"fraction of people who have not yet adopted, and the second expression F (t(cid:0) 1) is the\n",
			"fraction of agents who have adopted and can therefore be imitated. A continuous time\n",
			"\n",
			"3The version here omits a third parameter m which simply represents the portion of the population\n",
			"\n",
			"which could potentially be adopters. Here it is as if m = 1.\n",

			"As the parameters p and q are varied, the Bass model can (cid:133)t a wide variety of\n",
			"di\u2044usion curves, and as such has been used in both forecasting di\u2044usion and in empirical\n",
			"analyses of di\u2044usion, where one can estimate q and p from (cid:133)tting the model to data.\n",
			"There are also a number of extensions of the model to include things such as pricing\n",
			"and advertising.4 Note that the levels of p and q simply multiply time, and the ratio of\n",
			"q to p is the critical parameter that determines the overall shape of the curve. Thus, up\n",
			"to rescalings of time, the curves can be thought of as generated by a single parameter\n",
			"which captures the relative ratio of imitators to innovators.\n",
			"\n",
			"Part of the insight that emerges from the Bass model is the process behind some\n",
			"widely observed patterns in di\u2044usion studies. Since one of the (cid:133)rst studies of di\u2044usion\n",
			"by Tarde [584], who emphasized the importance of imitation in di\u2044usion, many studies\n",
			"have found di\u2044usion curves that are S-shaped. Perhaps the best known such studies\n",
			"where those of Ryan and Gross [544] and Griliches [295], which documented S-shaped\n",
			"di\u2044usion curves in the adoption of hybrid corn seeds among Iowa farmers. Figure 7.1\n",
			"provides an example of an S-shaped adoption curve, where di\u2044usion begins slowly, then\n",
			"accelerates, and then eventually slows down and asymptotes.\n",
			"\n",
			"To see how the Bass model works, and why it can exhibit the S-shape, note that\n",
			"initially there no agents in the population to imitate. Thus, the (cid:133)rst adopters are almost\n",
			"entirely those who adopt from their own spontaneous (cid:147)innovation.(cid:148) In equation (7.1),\n",
			"when F (t) is close to zero the equation is approximated by p. As the process progresses,\n",
			"there are more agents around to be imitated and this leads to an increase in the rate\n",
			"of di\u2044usion since now agents adopt through imitation as well as innovation. There is\n",
			"a balance that occurs as the process progresses, since there are more agents around\n",
			"\n",
			"4Examples of recent models of di\u2044usion, which push in various directions beyond that Bass model,\n",

			"to imitate, but fewer around to do the imitating. Eventually, the process has to slow\n",
			"down simply because there are no longer agents left around who might innovate or\n",
			"imitate.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are many features which are stationary in the original Bass model which can\n",
			"be enriched. For example, when it comes to spontaneous innovation it is not clear that\n",
			"the rate p should be constant over time. As Rogers [?] describes, the earliest adopters\n",
			"can often be very di\u2044erent in their characteristics from others who later adopt (even\n",
			"without imitation). One can enrich the model to incorporate things like heterogeneous\n",
			"costs of adoption among the population, as well as di\u2044erent sorts of imitation principles.\n",
			"For example, is it raw numbers of neighbors who have adopted that in(cid:135)uence an agent\n",
			"to adopt or fractions of neighbors? I will discuss some such variations of models in\n",
			"what follows and also in Chapter ??. For now, let us move to examining settings where\n",
			"social structure is modeled more explicitly.\n",
			"\n",
			"7.2 Spread of Information and Disease\n",
			"\n",
			"The component structure of a network naturally partitions a society into separate\n",
			"groups who do not interact or communicate with each other. While di\u2044erent compo-\n",

			"structure is also important to understand with respect to navigation, as if one can only\n",

			"\n",
			"7.2.1 Percolation, Component Size, Immunity, and Di\u2044usion\n",
			"\n",
			"The general problems of contagion, spreading of information, and navigation through\n",

			"The variations on the problem incorporate nodes that might be immune to infection\n",

			"\n",
			"\f244\n",
			"\n",
			"CHAPTER 7. DIFFUSION THROUGH NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"di\u2044usion and navigation have to be rich enough to capture such variations.\n",
			"\n",
			"This also leads to a point of overlap with what is known in the physics and math\n",
			"literatures as (cid:147)percolation theory.(cid:148)5 A canonical scenario from percolation theory is\n",
			"one where there is some substance, which is porous, and a central question is whether\n",
			"a liquid on one side of the substance will make it through to the other side. One\n",
			"might think of the substance as having holes or pores in it, and these possibly being\n",
			"connected to each other. The holes or pores can naturally be modeled as nodes with\n",
			"links between each other, and thus as a network or in many cases even as a lattice. The\n",
			"question of percolation is then equivalent to whether there exists a path from one side\n",
			"of the network to the other. The analysis of di\u2044usion and navigation on networks has\n",
			"thus drawn on tools and insights from percolation theory, and in turn enriched that\n",
			"theory.\n",
			"\n",
			"To begin, let us revisit the scenario studied in Section 4.3, which examined com-\n",
			"ponent size when some members of the population are completely immune. This also\n",
			"corresponds to percolation through a network when some nodes are removed. To recall\n",
			"the setting, there is a society of n individuals. One of them is initially infected with\n",
			"a disease. Members of the society are immune with a probability (cid:25). The question\n",
			"of whether the disease can spread to a nontrivial fraction of the population amounts\n",
			"to whether or not the initially infected individual lies in a component containing a\n",
			"nontrivial fraction of the population once the immune individuals are removed from\n",
			"the network. In Section 4.3 we considered Poisson random networks, but the analysis\n",
			"generalizes easily to other degree distributions (within the con(cid:133)guration model).\n",
			"\n",
			"We can do this as follows. Recall from (4.8) that the threshold for the emergence\n",
			"\n",
			"of a giant component in the con(cid:133)guration model is where6\n",
			"\n",
			"(cid:10)d2(cid:11)(cid:25) = 2hdi(cid:25) :\n",
			"\n",
			"(7.3)\n",
			"\n",
			"Here the subscript (cid:25) indicates that we are operating on a network where a proportion (cid:25)\n",
			"of the nodes are removed from the network uniformly at random, and the expectations\n",
			"are then taken with respect to the resulting degree distribution. So, we have an answer\n",
			"for the threshold of percolation in this system, or the point at which a single infected\n",
			"individual has a probability of infecting a number of others that becomes in(cid:133)nite as n\n",
			"grows.\n",
			"\n",
			"Before analyzing this expression with regards to di\u2044erent values of (cid:25) and degree\n",

			"became in(cid:133)nite when n grows, but this can also be explained by a simple (heuristic)\n",
			"argument, due to Cohen et al [151]. Consider starting at a given node and then\n",
			"randomly picking one of its neighbors. For the neighborhoods to keep expanding, it\n",
			"should be that the expected degree of this neighbor is at least two (the connection to\n",
			"the original node, plus a continuation to some other nodes). The expected degree of\n",

			"\n",
			"Consider the following scenario. Individuals are connected through a network that\n",

			"paths emanating from that node with a probability 1(cid:0)t. We then examine the resulting\n",

			"Let us start with the following variation on a matching model, which is really a\n",

			"\n",
			"While various models of di\u2044usion o\u2044er a number of insights, the models that are\n",

			"results. There are two obvious shortcomings: (cid:133)rst that analyses are for situations where\n",
			"degrees of neighbors are independent or at least approximately so, and second that the\n",
			"analyses generally examine tree-like networks, where there are few small cycles or loops\n",
			"in the network. These are both incompatible with many observed networks. Clearly,\n",
			"the features omitted in these models can have an impact on di\u2044usion. Correlation\n",
			"in degree can change the basic connectivity patterns which can increase or decrease\n",
			"the size of components depending on how it is introduced. Clustering, leads to some\n",
			"redundancy which can change the reach of new paths in a network, and also change\n",
			"infection patterns. In terms of introducing correlations in degrees, the basic approach\n",
			"is not so di\u00a2 cult a variation on what we have already considered. The main di\u2044erence\n",
			"\n",
			"is in the calculation of a neighbor(cid:146)s degree, which has been calculated using eP . In a\n",
			"\n",
			"model with degree correlation, this function would depend also on the degree of the\n",

			"Di\u2044usion concerns how a disease, information, or behavior moves through a network\n",
			"following the network structure. A related, but quite distinct, issue comes up when we\n",
			"consider someone or something actively navigating through a network. For instance,\n",
			"consider the problem of (cid:133)nding a node that has a certain attribute.\n",
			"In the classic\n",
			"Milgram [444] experiment, subjects were faced with the task of getting a letter to\n",
			"a particular person. More generally, this might be a challenge of trying to (cid:133)nd a\n",
			"webpage with particular information on it, or trying to (cid:133)nd someone who knows how\n",
			"to perform a given task, or trying to (cid:133)nd a (cid:133)le-sharer that has a given (cid:133)le. This can\n",
			"involve following network structure, but here with a speci(cid:133)c goal in mind and perhaps\n",
			"taking advantage of some knowledge about the network and/or attributes of the target.\n",
			"There are various approaches that one might try. One could just randomly navigate\n",
			"the network until one bumps into the target node. One could also take advantage of\n",
			"the structure of the network to better search. For instance, going to nodes that have\n",
			"more neighbors might save time if such nodes can also tell you something about their\n",
			"neighbors. Beyond that, one might use information about the nodes themselves to\n",
			"help in cases where nodes tend to be connected to other nodes with similar attributes.\n",
			"How do di\u2044erent search methods perform? How does search depend on the network\n",
			"structure?\n",
			"\n",
			"Here, we will examine two di\u2044erent approaches to navigating a network. One makes\n",
			"use of the network structure, for instance gravitating towards nodes of higher degree,\n",
			"but focusing on attributes of nodes that are purely network based (degree, centrality,\n",
			"etc.). The other approach makes use of other information about the nodes, such as\n",
			"profession, age, etc., which is not directly relevant in the network structure. However,\n",
			"when there is homophily in the network, then navigation that takes such traits into\n",
			"account can dramatically speed up navigation, as we shall see. This suggests that\n",
			"homophily can provide some social bene(cid:133)ts, at least in terms of navigation speed.\n",
			"\n",
			"7.3.1 Navigating Random Networks\n",
			"\n",
			"As a benchmark, let us start with the following problem. There is a single target node\n",
			"in a network of n nodes that we need to (cid:133)nd. We cannot know whether we have found\n",
			"the desired node until we examine it.\n",
			"\n",
			"We can derive an upper bound on the expected number of nodes that we need to\n",
			"visit in order to (cid:133)nd a given node. That can be found without taking advantage of\n",
			"\n",
			"\f7.3. SEARCH AND NAVIGATION ON NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"269\n",
			"\n",
			"the network structure at all. We can simply exhaustively visit the nodes one by one,\n",
			"picking the order uniformly at random. Here we do not use the network in any way,\n",
			"and there is an equal chance that the desired node will be the (cid:133)rst node we visit, or\n",
			"the second, ... or the last. The expected number of nodes we would have to visit under\n",
			"this method is the expectation of a uniform distribution, where the probability of it\n",

			"or roughly half of the nodes. With large numbers of nodes, this could be very time\n",
			"consuming and ine\u00a2 cient.\n",
			"\n",
			"Next, let us suppose that we use some aspects of the network structure as follows.\n",
			"We begin by randomly picking a node. If it is not the right node, then we randomly\n",
			"pick one of its neighbors, and so forth. This is similar to the process above.22 However,\n",
			"let us add a feature to the setting that makes search easier. When visiting a node, in\n",
			"addition to being able to discern whether it is the target node, we can also tell whether\n",
			"any of its neighbors are the target node. For instance, if we are looking for a person,\n",
			"we can just ask the person we are visiting whether they know the person we are looking\n",
			"for. Or, if we are crawling the world-wide-web, when we visit a given page its links\n",
			"could be labeled in such a way that we can tell whether any of those links point to\n",
			"our target page. In this case, when none of the neighbors of the node we are currently\n",
			"visiting is our target node, select the next node to be visited uniformly at random from\n",
			"the list of neighbors that we have not yet visited.23 To get a feel for the improvement,\n",
			"consider a regular network where each node has degree d. On the (cid:133)rst step we would\n",
			"(cid:133)nd d nodes. On the second step, we would (cid:133)nd an additional d (cid:0) 1, presuming that\n",
			"the new nodes found do not overlap with previously visited nodes.\n",
			"If overlap were\n",
			"never an issue, it would take us e\u2044ectively n\n",

			"before, and we cannot simply leap back to an earlier point. For instance, if the network is a tree and\n",
			"we start at a root node, and end up going down a branch that does not have the desired node, we\n",
			"could end up spending substantial time back-tracking.\n",

			"\n",
			"Early theory on information transmission in social networks includes the seminal work\n",

			"media and other interactions who then form opinions and convey information to and\n",
			"in(cid:135)uence other individuals who are less directly informed. This theory of opinion lead-\n",

			"also conducted a very in(cid:135)uential and extensive study of opinion formation, this time\n",
			"in Decatur, Illinois in the early 1950(cid:146)s. They conducted two sets of interviews with\n",
			"women over the age of sixteen, and asked the subjects about things beyond political\n",
			"opinions. In particular, Katz and Lazarsfeld asked the women about their opinions\n",
			"regarding household goods, fashion, movies, and local public a\u2044airs (including poli-\n",

			"identify individuals who played a role in multiple changes of opinion, and they dubbed\n",
			"these individuals the (cid:147)opinion leaders.(cid:148) Katz and Lazarsfeld found evidence that while\n",
			"sometimes opinion leaders held higher social status, there were many cases where opin-\n",

			"when it came to various household decisions. Opinion leaders were often distinguished\n",
			"by their gregariousness and the size of their families (which is then correlated with\n",
			"their age and experience).2\n",
			"\n",
			"Beyond the applications mentioned above, which provide just a glimpse of some of\n",

			"critical in showing how social connections play a role in learning and the formation of\n",
			"opinions, and that di\u2044erent agents in a society have di\u2044erent in(cid:135)uences. To more fully\n",
			"understand how this might work, we need to examine models that explicitly account\n",
			"for social network structure in the patterns of information dissemination. Some of\n",

			"Beyond knowing whether or not beliefs converge, we are also interested in characterizing\n",
			"what beliefs converge to when they converge, which agents have substantial in(cid:135)uence\n",
			"in the society, and when it is that a concensus is reached. These correspond to several\n",
			"of the questions that we began the chapter with.\n",
			"\n",
			"Let us begin with a couple of simple observations. First, it is straightforward to\n",
			"see that if beliefs converge, then a strongly connected and closed group of agents will\n",
			"reach a concensus.\n",
			"\n",
			"Let us say that a group of agents C (cid:26) f1; : : : ; ng reaches a consensus under T for\n",
			"\n",
			"an initial vector of beliefs p(0) if limt pi(t) = limt pj(t) for each i and j in C.\n",
			"\n",
			"Proposition 8.3.1 Under T , any strongly connected and closed group of individuals\n",
			"reaches a consensus for every initial vector of beliefs if and only if it is aperiodic.\n",
			"\n",
			"Proof of Proposition 8.3.1: First, we know from above that such a group will have\n",
			"convergent beliefs if and only if it is aperiodic. Since a consensus cannot be reached if\n",
			"beliefs do not converge, to conclude the claim it su\u00a2 ces to show that aperiodicity of\n",
			"a strongly connected and closed group implies consensus. So, suppose to the contrary\n",
			"that for some p(0) the belief of the agents in C converge, but to some p0 such that\n",
			"p0i 6= p0j for some i and j in C. Without loss of generality, we may ignore agents outside\n",
			"of C, so consider C to be the full set of agents f1; : : : ; ng and relabel the agents so that\n",
			"p01 (cid:21) p02 (cid:21) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:21) p0n. Find the minimal i such that p0i > p0i+1. Given that agents are\n",
			"strongly connected, it must be that some agent k (cid:20) i has Tkh > 0 for some h (cid:21) i + 1.\n",
			"Convergence then implies that for any \", we can (cid:133)nd a large enough t0 such that for all\n",
			"t > t0:\n",
			"\n",
			"pk(t) =Xj\n",

			"\n",
			"Tkjp0j + \" (cid:20) (1 (cid:0) Tkh)p01 + Tkhp0h + \":\n",
			"\n",
			"But since the right hand expression is less than p0k for a small enough \", we reach a\n",
			"contradiction.\n",
			"\n",
			"Thus, we have a complete characterization of consensus for strongly connected and\n",
			"closed groups, which is that they reach a consensus whenever they converge. The\n",
			"logic is evident from the proof, which is basically that a given individual cannot reach\n",
			"a higher limit than each of his or her neighbors, since his or her belief involves a\n",
			"weighted average of those beliefs.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f8.3. IMITATION AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE MODELS: THE DEGROOT MODEL303\n",
			"\n",
			"So let us partition the society into strongly connected and closed groups of individ-\n",
			"uals, and then the remaining individuals. If there is more than one strongly connected\n",
			"and closed group, then clearly the society will not always reach a consensus except in\n",
			"the rare cases where the initial beliefs are such that separate closed and strongly con-\n",
			"nected groups happen to reach the same limit. For instance, if one closed group starts\n",
			"with common beliefs at 1 and a separate closed group starts with common beliefs at\n",
			"0, they will forever stay apart. So, in order to reach consensus when the initial beliefs\n",
			"are not chosen exceptionally, it must be that there is exactly one closed and strongly\n",
			"connected group in the society. Note that it is easy to see that there always exists at\n",
			"least one such group (see Exercise 8.7), and that a society can be partitioned into some\n",
			"number of strongly connected and closed groups and then a remaining set of agents\n",
			"who each have at least one directed path to an agent in a strongly and connected group.\n",
			"\n",
			"Corollary 8.3.1 A consensus is reached in the DeGroot model if and only if there\n",
			"is exactly one strongly connected and closed group of agents and T is aperiodic on that\n",
			"group.\n",
			"\n",
			"This also leads to another characterization of consensus due to Berger [51].\n",

			"Corollary 8.3.2 (Berger [51]) A consensus is reached in the DeGroot model if and\n",
			"only if there exists t such that some column of T t has all positive entries.\n",
			"\n",
			"We can think of an entry [T t]ij as keeping track of the indirect weight that an agent i\n",
			"places on agent j, through paths of length t. Thus, if some column of T t has all positive\n",
			"entries, then every agent is putting some indirect weight on the agent corresponding to\n",
			"that column. This implies that all agents must have an indirect path to some agent,\n",
			"and so there must be exactly one strongly connected and closed group of agents. Once\n",
			"a column is all positive, it stays that way, which guarantees aperiodicity (a not too\n",

			"\n",
			"p(t) =h(1 (cid:0) (cid:21)t)I + (cid:21)tbTi p(t (cid:0) 1)\n",
			"\n",
			"where I is the identity matrix, (cid:21)t 2 (0; 1] is an adjustment factor, and bT is a stochastic\n",

			"less) weight on his or her own belief over time.\n",
			"\n",
			"Example 8.3.6 Only Weighting those with Similar Beliefs.\n",
			"\n",
			"The following model of Krause [?] (see also Hegselmann and Krause [307]) allows\n",
			"an agent to only pay attention to other agents whose beliefs are not far from his or her\n",
			"own. Thus, the agent has a sort of distrust for information that is too di\u2044erent from\n",
			"his or her own. Here,\n",

			"otherwise.\n",
			"\n",
			"Thus, an agent places equal weight on all opinions that are within some distance d\n",
			"of his or her own current opinion. This substantially complicates the process, as the\n",
			"updating depends on the speci(cid:133)cs of the opinions rather than just on time. This is also\n",
			"closely related to the model of De\u2044uant et al [179] and Weisbuch et al [?], where at\n",
			"each time two agents are randomly matched and then update their beliefs only if the\n",
			"beliefs are close enough to each other.\n",
			"\n",
			"The reaching of a consensus in the above generalizations of the DeGroot model are\n",
			"\n",
			"covered under the following result of Lorenz [419].\n",
			"\n",
			"Theorem 8.3.2 Suppose that T (p(t); t) satis(cid:133)es the following conditions:\n",

			"\n",
			"\f8.3. IMITATION AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE MODELS: THE DEGROOT MODEL305\n",
			"\n",
			"The proof works by bounding below the weights that agents must place on anyone\n",
			"with whom they communicate other over time, and then tying these back to the initial\n",
			"beliefs and establishing convergence. E\u2044ectively, with weights bounded below, a belief\n",
			"cannot stay too much above or below its neighbors(cid:146)beliefs over time, and so conver-\n",
			"gence to a consensus is still guaranteed. The reader is referred to Lorenz [419] for the\n",
			"details. The assumptions of each agent updating based on his or her own beliefs at\n",
			"every time, agents paying mutual attention to each other, and having a lower bound\n",
			"on attention (which then also puts an upper bound on how many agents an agent can\n",
			"pay attention to) are stronger than necessary, but simplify the analysis, and allow the\n",
			"theorem to capture quite non-stationary updating processes in a class that signi(cid:133)cantly\n",
			"generalizes the basic DeGroot model in some directions. The requirement of symmetric\n",
			"attention paid implies that any path connected agents are strongly connected, which\n",
			"is a way of guaranteeing that beliefs reach an overall consensus. If for instance, this\n",
			"condition is violated, and there are two separate strongly connected groups and an\n",
			"agent who pays attention to both of these groups, then the two groups might reach dif-\n",
			"ferent consensuses, and the agent paying attention to both might have an intermediate\n",
			"limiting belief. The assumption that Tii > 0 is not really essential to the result, but\n",
			"is an easy way to guarantee that the setting is aperiodic no matter how T varies with\n",
			"time and circumstances so that things converge nicely. The bounding below of positive\n",
			"weights by some (cid:14) > 0 is not a necessary condition, but some sort of bound is needed.\n",
			"To see this, simply consider an example where two agents pay attention to each other,\n",
			"but the weight each one places on the other(cid:146)s belief goes to 0 at a su\u00a2 ciently high rate\n",
			"as the others beliefs get closer, and then their beliefs never converge (see Exercise 8.9).\n",
			"It is clear that Theorem 8.3.2 must allow for various sets of agents to have di\u2044erent\n",
			"limiting beliefs, as in the Krause [?] model, no updating occurs at all between agents\n",
			"whose beliefs start out at a distance of more than d. For example, if d < 1=2 it is easy\n",
			"to (cid:133)nd examples in that model where there will be multiple limiting sets of beliefs.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Krause model has a discontinuity in it, as an agent will pay attention to\n",
			"one belief at a certain distance, but not another one which a disance of more than\n",
			"\" away. That discontinuity turns out to be important in determining whether or not\n",

			"action only once. The action A pays 1, while the action B pays either 0 or 2, with\n",

			"observe each others(cid:146)actions (but not payo\u2044s). Agents see all of the previous actions\n",

			"pays 2 for all of the agents who choose it, or (cid:147)bad(cid:148) and pays 0 for all of the agents\n",
			"who choose it. Agents know that the chances that B is bad or good are equal. In\n",
			"addition, they each get to observe a private signal about the state of nature ((cid:147)good(cid:148)\n",
			"or (cid:147)bad(cid:148)). The signal of agent i, denoted si takes on a value (cid:147)good(cid:148)or (cid:147)bad(cid:148). If the\n",

			"A. If the second agent sees (cid:147)bad(cid:148), then he has e\u2044ectively seen one good and one bad\n",

			"knowledge through the \ufb01lter of the action choices by individuals pursuing their own\n",
			"interest. The implicit assumption was that the outcomes of actions would occur after\n",
			"all decisions were made. In some settings, however, actions bear lessons for future\n",
			"decisions. Firms may adjust their prices after the market response. Unemployed agents\n",
			"observe the results of their search. Farmers observe some results at the end of a crop\n",
			"cycle before making choices for the next one. Evidence on the risks of cousin marriages\n",
			"eventually becomes known. These settings share the common feature that actions send\n",
			"a random signal: chance plays a role in the \ufb01nding of a new job; agricultural outputs\n",
			"are famously uncertain; the outcomes of medical treatments depend to a large extent\n",
			"on personal characteristics that cannot be observed.\n",
			"\n",
			"In this chapter, the probabilities of the actions\u2019 outcomes depend on the state\n",
			"of nature. The signal issued by an action may be an output, a payoff, or some other\n",
			"variable. This new channel of information introduces a speci\ufb01c property: if one wants\n",
			"to learn whether an action is pro\ufb01table for the given state of nature, one has to try\n",

			"The Armed-Bandit Problem\n",
			"An agent who can repeatedly choose an action takes into account the immediate pay-\n",
			"off of his action and his learning for better decisions. He is like a player who pulls\n",
			"one of the two arms of a slot machine to generate a random output of money. One\n",
			"of them, unknown to the player, generates on average a higher output. The armed-\n",
			"bandit problem is to choose which arm to pull. Berry (1972) and Rothschild (1974)\n",
			"have analyzed this well-known problem for a \ufb01nite number of actions.1 Eventually,\n",
			"the agent settles for one arm, which he believes to be more productive than the other.\n",
			"Because he stops using the other arm, his belief is invariant; but it may be incorrect.\n",
			"The nonconvergence to the truth may be optimal even though the agent fully inter-\n",
			"nalizes the bene\ufb01t of learning, when deviation from the myopic maximization is more\n",
			"costly than the potential bene\ufb01t from experimentation.\n",
			"\n",
			"Social Learning from the Outcomes of Others\u2019 Actions\n",
			"In the standard framework of social learning, the nonconvergence to the truth may\n",
			"be suboptimal because agents do not take into account the informational bene\ufb01ts of\n",
			"their actions for others. In this chapter, following the current state of the literature,\n",
			"we study whether the agents\u2019 beliefs converge to the truth or not, as the number of\n",
			"observations becomes arbitrarily large. We will not analyze the rate of convergence or\n",
			"the cost of the failure to take the information bene\ufb01ts into account.\n",
			"\n",
			"Learning the Demand Curve of a Monopoly\n",
			"Finding the demand curve and adjusting the price to the demand are basic problems\n",
			"in economics. We begin in Section 8.1.1 with a model of McLennan (1984), who\n",
			"assumes a zero\u2013one demand where the probability of a sale in a period depends\n",
			"on the price quoted by a monopoly during the period. The monopoly is run by\n",
			"a sequence of one-period managers, who choose a price to maximize the period\u2019s\n",
			"expected payoff without experimenting for the bene\ufb01t of future managers. There\n",
			"are two possible schedules for the demand, and by assumption, they intersect at a\n",
			"price that separates the optimal prices for the two schedules. The sequence of prices\n",
			"chosen by the managers converges with strictly positive probability to the intersection\n",
			"point between the demand curves, where there is no learning. In such a case there\n",
			"is no convergence to the truth. The model is remarkably tractable and yields useful\n",
			"insights. A related model by Kiefer (1989) assumes that the monopoly chooses the\n",
			"quantity and that the equilibrium price is subject to an additive shock. The model has\n",

			"to be simulated and generates similar properties (Section 8.1.2). The limited ability\n",
			"of agents to learn in this context may have some implications for the rigidity of prices\n",
			"or individuals\u2019 behavior.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Determinants of Economic Success: Luck or Effort?\n",
			"The model of McLennan can be applied to the case of an agent who searches for a\n",
			"new job or plans for a new career. His effort depends on his belief about the relative\n",
			"contributions of effort and luck to the probability of success. This belief is affected by\n",
			"his past successes and failures. The model of Section 8.2.1 explains how a low initial\n",
			"belief in the value of effort may set the agent on a path where he never learns that\n",
			"effort actually pays off. This property has obvious policy implications.\n",
			"\n",
			"Multidimensional Reality and Unidimensional Outcomes\n",
			"The factors that determine economic success obviously have more than one dimen-\n",
			"sion, and yet the experience from an average of successes or failures is one-dimensional.\n",
			"It is not surprising that such restricted experience does not enable agents to learn the\n",
			"true state. An extension of the model of McLennan leads to a model of Piketty (1995),\n",
			"which exhibits interesting properties of the limit distributions of beliefs (Section\n",
			"8.2.2). For example, successful children of poor parents are more likely to believe that\n",
			"effort has a large effect than those who remain poor. Such properties are not based on\n",
			"self-serving psychological mechanisms, but depend on the interaction between belief\n",
			"and effort.\n",
			"\n",
			"Complete Learning with Diverse Private Beliefs\n",
			"In the previous models, the agents share a common history, and the weight of that\n",
			"history may prevent them from learning the truth. One way out of the trap of history\n",
			"is to have new agents with strong beliefs who reject the lesson of history. These agents\n",
			"choose different actions, the outcomes of which generate new information, which\n",
			"may bring everyone out of the trap. Bala and Goyal (1995) analyze social learning\n",
			"from the outcomes of actions chosen in a \ufb01nite set (Section 8.3.1). This framework\n",
			"can be applied to an agricultural setting where farmers choose one crop in a small\n",
			"menu and observe the output at the end of a cycle. A \ufb01nite number of actions may\n",
			"also be an approximation of an action in a continuum (e.g., a monopoly\u2019s price). The\n",
			"technique of analysis relies on the \ufb01nite number of actions: it implies that some actions\n",
			"are taken an in\ufb01nite number of times and thus reveal their true payoff by the law of\n",
			"large numbers. This revelation of information is obviously not suf\ufb01cient for learning\n",
			"the truth, for the agents (e.g., farmers) could herd on a suboptimal action. However,\n",
			"no incorrect herd can take place if some agents have beliefs that are arbitrarily close\n",
			"to the truth. This assumption is reminiscent of the unbounded beliefs assumption in\n",
			"Chapter 3. The operating mechanism is different, however. Agents never learn from\n",
			"others\u2019 choices (by an assumption of bounded rationality). They learn only from the\n",
			"outputs. The agents with beliefs close to the truth choose an optimal action, and the\n",

			"\n",
			"To learn one needs to forget.\n",
			"\n",
			"When agents observe a sample of past actions or different sets of neigh-\n",
			"bors, they do not share a common public history. The diversity of obser-\n",
			"vations may facilitate social learning because there is no common public\n",
			"history that dominates all individual beliefs. Social learning may be faster\n",
			"if agents observe a smaller sample of past actions. As the social learning\n",
			"cannot be summarized by the martingale of the public belief, the analysis\n",
			"of the convergence of beliefs and actions requires new tools: the average\n",
			"social welfare function, which operates like a Lyapunov function, and the\n",
			"welfare-improving principle.\n",
			"\n",
			"In all models so far, agents know the entire history of actions. This assumption may be\n",
			"too strong when the number of periods is large. (Note, however, that the entire history\n",
			"is summarized by one number, the public belief.) It is now relaxed: each agent observes\n",
			"only part of the past. We have seen in the previous chapter how the commonly known\n",
			"history of actions can dominate private beliefs and prevent agents from revealing\n",
			"their private information through their actions. If the common memory prevents the\n",
			"diffusion of private information, a restriction on the observation of past actions may\n",
			"be ef\ufb01cient.\n",
			"\n",
			"Two settings are considered. In the main one, agents are put in an exogenous\n",
			"sequence, as in all models of social learning in previous chapters, but they observe a\n",
			"small random sample from the set of past observations. The sampling is done over all\n",
			"past observations and not just over the most recent ones. The second setting departs\n",
			"from the sequential structure: agents act like farm managers who observe in each\n",
			"period a random sample of crop choices in other farms.\n",
			"\n",
			"Partial Recall and Sampling\n",
			"Section 5.1 is derived from Smith and S\u00f8rensen (1997): agents are put in an exogenous\n",
			"sequence as in the BHW model with two states and two actions. A \ufb01rst phase, the seed\n",
			"\n",
			"95\n",
			"\n",
			"\f96\n",
			"\n",
			"Limited Memories\n",
			"\n",
			"phase, is introduced to build an initial population for sampling: in that phase, which\n",
			"may be short, each agent acts according to his private information. In the second\n",
			"and main phase, each agent samples a \ufb01xed number N of agents in the history of\n",
			"actions. The properties of the social learning depend on the size of the sample and the\n",
			"distribution of private beliefs. A numerical simulation shows that a smaller sample\n",
			"size N improves the ef\ufb01ciency of social learning after some period. This property\n",
			"validates the intuition in the \ufb01rst paragraph.\n",
			"\n",
			"The sampling restriction does not prevent the occurrence of cascades when private\n",
			"beliefs are bounded, because a suf\ufb01ciently long string of identical actions is possible\n",
			"and such a string generates observations of identical actions that initiate a cascade.\n",
			"However, if private beliefs are unbounded, beliefs converge to the truth.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Average Welfare Function and the Welfare-Improving Principle\n",
			"When agents do not observe the complete history, there is no common memory of\n",
			"the past, and the fundamental process of social learning in Figure 3.1 does not apply.\n",
			"Because the observation set of each agent is idiosyncratic, the learning from others\n",
			"cannot be summarized by a public belief that is a converging martingale. When an\n",
			"agent observes only a subset of past actions, the sample of his observations is speci\ufb01c\n",
			"to him. Others have therefore a more complex inference task when they observe\n",
			"his action. The technical analysis of the convergence of beliefs and actions becomes\n",
			"more dif\ufb01cult. In order to derive general results, Banerjee and Fudenberg (1995)\n",
			"introduced a new and elegant tool, the average welfare function. This tool has been\n",
			"also used by Smith and S\u00f8rensen to analyze the convergence properties of the present\n",
			"model (Section 5.1.2).\n",
			"\n",
			"The average welfare function (AWF), not to be confused with the social welfare\n",
			"function, is the expected payoff of an outsider with the same payoff function as the\n",
			"agents of the model but who has a \ufb01xed belief about the state of nature and who\n",
			"copies the action of a randomly selected agent. Without loss of generality, this belief\n",
			"can be chosen with equal probabilities for all states. The outsider\u2019s payoff is thus the\n",
			"average payoff of the copied actions for all possible states. Suppose now that agents\n",
			"gradually learn from others. Learning means that the agents do strictly better than just\n",
			"imitating the action of another random agent. As long as agents learn in this sense, the\n",
			"AWF is strictly increasing between consecutive periods: this is the welfare-improving\n",
			"principle (WIP). It provides a criterion to prove that learning takes place. Because the\n",
			"AWF is bounded, it converges. By analyzing the value of the AWF at the limit point, we\n",
			"will be able to assess how agents behave and what they learn when time goes to in\ufb01nity.\n",
			"\n",
			"Adequate and Complete Learning\n",
			"Adequate learning has been de\ufb01ned by Smith and S\u00f8rensen (1997) as the situation\n",
			"where at the limit (t \u2192 \u221e) all agents take the action that is optimal for the true state.\n",
			"Complete learning is the situation where the belief of an agent who makes a decision\n",
			"in period t tends to the true state \u03b8 \u2208 {0, 1}. Complete learning implies adequate\n",
			"\n",
			"\f5.1 The Sequential Model with Sampling\n",
			"\n",
			"97\n",
			"\n",
			"learning, but in general the reverse is not true. However, in models with sampling,\n",
			"adequate and complete learning are equivalent: if there is adequate learning, the\n",
			"likelihood ratio from the observation of one investment tends to in\ufb01nity. Hence,\n",
			"for any value of the private belief, the belief of the agent tends to the truth: there is\n",
			"complete learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"Convergence\n",
			"Smith and S\u00f8rensen (1997) use the WIP to show that learning is adequate in the\n",
			"sequential model with sampling if private beliefs are unbounded. Their work addresses\n",
			"a number of other issues, which cannot be considered here. One issue has not been\n",
			"investigated, however. The previous chapter has emphasized that the importance of\n",
			"the convergence to the truth may be exaggerated. What really matters is the speed of\n",
			"the convergence. We have seen that this convergence is slow, even when private beliefs\n",
			"are unbounded. It remains to be seen how the restriction to an observation sample of\n",
			"size two, for example, would accelerate the convergence in a model with unbounded\n",
			"private beliefs.\n",
			"\n",
			"Sampling in a Very Large Population\n",
			"Section 5.3, taken from Banerjee and Fudenberg (1995), departs from the sequential\n",
			"model for the \ufb01rst time in this book. In each period, there is a large number of new\n",
			"agents (a continuum) who take some action. Each of these agents samples N other\n",
			"agents. A large diversity of information is thus imbedded in the new population with\n",
			"different fractions of investing agents in the two states of nature. The model is actually\n",
			"more a model of chain sampling than a model of social learning. The properties of\n",
			"the model are sharply different from those in Section 5.1. If N \u2265 3, beliefs converge\n",
			"to the truth even if agents do not have any private information.\n",
			"\n",
			"5.1 The Sequential Model with Sampling\n",
			"Consider the 2-by-2-by-2 model of Section 4.1.1: there are two states \u03b8 \u2208 {0, 1} and\n",
			"two actions x \u2208 {0, 1}, and agent t maximizes his payoff in period t, (E t[\u03b8] \u2212 c)xt\n",
			"with 0 < c < 1\n",
			"2 . Private beliefs (probability of state 1) have in state \u03b8 a c.d.f., which\n",
			"is de\ufb01ned by F \u03b8 . Both states have the same probability ex ante. Following Smith and\n",
			"S\u00f8rensen (1997), we depart from that model by assuming that for any t \u2265 T + 1,\n",
			"agent t observes N randomly selected actions in the history ht = {x1, . . . , xt\u22121}. The\n",
			"values of N and T are \ufb01xed such that N \u2264 T, and the random selection is as from an\n",

			"\n",
			"In general, the two distributions may not be perfectly symmetric and the statement\n",
			"needs to be modi\ufb01ed accordingly. The main property, however, is that the observation\n",
			"of one investment in a sample of size two provides weak evidence on the state. When\n",
			"an agent faces weak evidence from the observation of others, he relies more on his\n",
			"private information. The occurrence of weak evidence is the key channel through\n",
			"which private information is fed into the process of social learning. Weak evidence\n",

			"Peers exert enormous in(cid:135)uence on human behavior. It is easy to cite examples, ranging\n",
			"from which products we buy, whether or not we engage in criminal activities, how\n",
			"much education we pursue, to which profession we choose. There is a vast literature\n",
			"on the subject including research by social psychologists, sociologists, researchers in\n",
			"education, and economists. We have already seen examples of studies that touch on\n",
			"these issues, and there is also a good bit known about statistical issues of identifying\n",
			"peer e\u2044ects (see Chapter 13). The purpose of this chapter is to provide foundations for\n",
			"understanding how the structure of social networks in(cid:135)uences behavior. For example, if\n",
			"we change the network of social interactions, how will behavior change? This issue has\n",
			"a rich history in sociology, and has more recently emerged in economics and computer\n",
			"science. Some aspects of this were touched on in the chapters on di\u2044usion and learning,\n",
			"but there are many situations where social in(cid:135)uences involve human decision-making\n",
			"rather than pure contagion or updating. The focus in this chapter complements those\n",
			"earlier chapters by expanding the analysis to explicitly account for how individual\n",

			"\n",
			"The main complication in the analysis of this chapter compared to the study of\n",
			"di\u2044usion and learning is that behavior depends in more complicated ways on what\n",
			"neighbors are doing. For example, if an individual is choosing a piece of software or\n",
			"some other product and wants it to be compatible with a majority of neighbors, then\n",
			"this is a coordination game, and behavior can change abruptly depending on how many\n",

			"a network setting.\n",
			"\n",
			"The chapter begins by showing how a variation on the ideas we saw in the learning\n",
			"and di\u2044usion analyses can be used to study behaviors. In particular, I start with a\n",
			"model where people react to their neighbors in a way that can be captured proba-\n",
			"bilistically, predicting their actions as a function of the distribution of their neighbors(cid:146)\n",
			"play. After this, I introduce game-theoretic settings, where richer behaviors are studied\n",
			". Here there are two main types of situations that are considered and which capture\n",
			"many of the applications of interest. One type is where there are strategic complemen-\n",
			"tarities, as in choosing compatible technologies or pursuing education, where players(cid:146)\n",
			"incentives to take a given action increase as more neighbors take that action. This leads\n",
			"to nice properties of equilibria and we can deduce quite a bit about how players(cid:146)strate-\n",
			"gies will vary with their position in a network and how overall behavior in the society\n",
			"responds to network structure changes. The type of strategic interaction considered is\n",
			"one with the opposite incentive structure: that of strategic substitutes. There players\n",
			"can (cid:147)free ride(cid:148) on the actions of their neighbors, such as in gathering information or\n",
			"providing certain services, and a player(cid:146)s incentive to take a given action decreases as\n",
			"more neighbors take that action. This leads to quite di\u2044erent conclusions about player\n",
			"behavior and equilibrium structure. I also discuss models that are designed to capture\n",
			"dynamics of behavior.\n",
			"\n",
			"9.1 Decisions and Social Interaction\n",
			"\n",
			"Let me begin by discussing an approach to modeling interactive behavior that builds\n",
			"from the tools from the last two chapters on di\u2044usion an learning. To model decisions\n",
			"in the face of social interaction one needs to characterize how a given individual will\n",
			"behave as a function of the actions of his or her neighbors. For instance, will the\n",
			"individual want to buy a new product if some particular subset of his or her neighbors\n",
			"are buying the product? Generally, the answer to such a question depends on a series\n",
			"of characteristics of the individual, the product, the alternative products, as well as\n",
			"the set of neighbors buying the product.1 As a useful starting point, we can think\n",
			"\n",
			"1The implications of interdependencies in consumer choices have been studied in a variety of\n",
			"contexts including the implications for how (cid:133)rms might price goods (e.g., see Katz and Shapiro [362])\n",
			"and implications for increasing returns (e.g., see Arthur [19] and Romer [?]). For more background\n",

			"In order to (cid:133)x ideas and provide a benchmark, consider a setting where interaction is\n",
			"symmetric in the sense that any individual can be in(cid:135)uenced by any (or every) other,\n",
			"and the particular identities of neighbors are not important, just the relative numbers of\n",
			"agents taking various actions. Each individual chooses one of two actions. This might\n",
			"be a choice of either smoking or not, or choosing between two di\u2044erent technologies,\n",
			"going to one park or another, going to vote or not, voting for one of two candidates,\n",
			"etc.\n",
			"\n",
			"The two actions are labeled as 0 and 1, and time evolves in discrete periods, t 2\n",

			"In some applications, if the state of the system is st = s at time t, then there is\n",
			"a well-de(cid:133)ned probability that the system will be in state st+1 = s0 at time t + 1.\n",
			"That is, if we know how many people are taking action 1 at date t, then there is a\n",
			"well-de(cid:133)ned distribution over the number of people taking action 1 at date t + 1. This\n",
			"might be deterministic or random, depending on what we assume about how people\n",
			"react to others. For example, it might be that each person looks at the state at the\n",
			"end of time t and then chooses the action which leads to the greatest bene(cid:133)t for that\n",
			"individual presuming that others will act as at time t; for instance if we pick one person\n",
			"at random from the society and ask them to update their choice. It might be that we\n",
			"have all individuals respond, or each one respond probabilistically. What is critical is\n",
			"that are well-de(cid:133)ned probabilities of being in each state tomorrow as a function of the\n",

			"uniformly at random2 and updates his or her action based on the current number of\n",
			"people in the society taking action 1 or 0.3 How an individual updates his or her\n",
			"action depends on the state of the system. In particular, let ps denote the probability\n",
			"that the individual chooses action 1 conditional on s out of the other n (cid:0) 1 agents\n",
			"choosing action 1. This form of updating could be a form of best reply behavior, where\n",
			"an individual (myopically) chooses an action which gives a highest payo\u2044 given the\n",
			"current actions of the other individuals. So, for instance, the individual decides on\n",
			"whether or not to go to/stay at the beach based on how many others are there. It\n",
			"could also be something similar to the contagion of a disease that we saw before, but\n",
			"now where the transition between infection and susceptible is a richer function of the\n",
			"state of the system.\n",
			"\n",
			"Given this, the transition probabilities from one state to another are completely\n",
			"determined by the vector p = (p0; : : : ; pn(cid:0)1). For example the probability of going\n",

			"are unstable. This takes a bit more argument, but to see the basic idea, consider a\n",

			"so no equilibrium is stable. In Figure 9.5.1, only the upper right hand equilibrium is a\n",
			"stable one, and there are no stable equilibria for the complete network.\n",
			"\n",
			"It is also worth noting that all equilibria in this public good game are ine\u00a2 cient, in\n",
			"the sense that they stop short of maximizing total utility. Each player is maximizing his\n",
			"or her own payo\u2044, and yet his or her action also bene(cid:133)ts other agents. For example in a\n",
			"dyad, the total production is x(cid:3) which maximizes f (x)(cid:0)cx, while overall societal utility\n",
			"is 2f (x) (cid:0) cx which will generally have a higher maximizer if f is smooth and strictly\n",
			"concave. This is endemic to public goods provision and players generally under-provide\n",
			"public goods because they do not fully account for the bene(cid:133)ts that their actions bestow\n",
			"on others. In this setting, there are also some di\u2044erences across equilibria in terms of\n",
			"the total utility that they generate. For example, if we consider the two di\u2044erent\n",
			"equilibria in the top two networks in Figure 9.5.1, they result in di\u2044erent aggregate\n",
			"payo\u2044s. The one with one specialist on the left results in a payo\u2044 of 3f (1)(cid:0)c, while the\n",
			"one with two specialists on the right results in a payo\u2044 of f (2) + 2f (1) (cid:0) 2c. Here we\n",
			"can rank these two equilibria, as the one on the left generates more total utility. We see\n",
			"this by noting that the di\u2044erence between the one on the left and the one on the right\n",
			"\n",
			"\f9.5. RICHER ACTION SPACES\n",
			"\n",
			"375\n",

			"(as otherwise, a player would prefer to increase the production to 2 even by himself or\n",
			"herself) and so this di\u2044erence is positive. For more general networks, the comparisons\n",

			"\n",
			"A powerful way of answering such questions is by examining the best-response\n",

			"an equilibrium is (cid:147)hard to (cid:133)nd,(cid:148) take us a bit beyond the scope of this text, but let\n",
			"me sketch the basic ideas.\n",
			"\n",
			"To any algorithm that computes equilibria, there are some inputs that describe\n",
			"the game. In the case of a graphical game, the inputs are the number of players, the\n",
			"network that connects them, and each player(cid:146)s payo\u2044 function. The number of players\n",
			"is simply n, and the information about the network can be coded in an n(cid:2) n matrix, so\n",
			"involves n2 bits of information to convey (although this can be lowered in some classes\n",
			"of games). If each player has a degree of at most some d, then each player(cid:146)s payo\u2044\n",
			"matrix has 2d+1 entries, indicating the payo\u2044 as a function of each vector of choices of\n",
			"0 or 1 for each neighbor and the player. Thus, the full description of the game involves\n",
			"something on the order of n2 plus n times a constant (related to the maximum d) bits\n",
			"of information. Now, given this information, we start to construct an algorithm for\n",
			"(cid:133)nding an equilibrium. This involves a description of a series of steps that use the\n",
			"information we have about the game and do some calculations, and then eventually\n",
			"spit out a list of strategies for each player. The question is how many steps will it take\n",
			"to terminate and tell us what an equilibrium is. The method of counting steps that is\n",
			"generally followed is to look at the upper bound, or worst possible performance. So,\n",
			"the performance measure is to (cid:133)nd a game and payo\u2044 structure that would lead to the\n",
			"most steps before the given algorithm would (cid:133)nd an equilibrium, and to keep track\n",
			"of this as a function of n. Algorithms which are considered to be relatively quick are\n",
			"those for which the upper bound on the number of steps needed to (cid:133)nd an equilibrium\n",
			"is at most some polynomial function of n. Algorithms which are considered slow are\n",
			"those such that there exist games for which (cid:133)nding an equilibrium takes a number of\n",
			"steps beyond polynomial in n as, for example, in a setting where worst case scenarios\n",
			"require that any algorithm use a number of steps that grows exponentially in n. It\n",
			"is di\u00a2 cult to show that a problem is such that all algorithms sometimes require more\n",
			"than a polynomial number of steps, and there is a very deep and long-standing open\n",
			"question on which hinges the answer for a number of problems including equilibrium\n",
			"computation in a class of graphical games.39\n",
			"\n",
			"There are a number of side issues which accompany such a discussion. For instance,\n",
			"is it reasonable to measure the performance of an algorithm for computing equilibria\n",

			"based on worst cases? Is an exponential number of steps really that much more than a\n",
			"high order polynomial when we examine some given number n, or how large does n have\n",
			"to be before there is a serious distinction for the problem in question? Is this the right\n",
			"accounting for (cid:147)complexity(cid:148) given that we are not keeping track of how complicated\n",
			"the calculation at each step might be? Are there large classes of graphical games for\n",
			"which things will be much easier, and are the graphical games for which computing an\n",
			"equilibrium is di\u00a2 cult very interesting? What happens when we look for approximate\n",
			"equilibria (so that players nearly maximize their payo\u2044) instead of exact equilibria?\n",
			"Are there other de(cid:133)nitions of equilibria for which computation is easy? These are\n",
			"all questions that have received attention, and do not have easy answers. There are\n",
			"also some more di\u00a2 culties that we face with graphical games. For instance, if players\n",
			"do not have some maximal degree, but the maximal degree grows with n, then even\n",
			"describing payo\u2044s could take up to 2n bits of information. Part of the reason that\n",
			"the threshold and best shot games were easy to handle as that the payo\u2044s were quite\n",
			"simple to describe.40\n",
			"\n",
			"Let me brie(cid:135)y summarize what is known about (cid:133)nding equilibria of graphical games.\n",
			"In the case where the network is a tree, then there are algorithms which involve a\n",
			"number of steps which is polynomial in n and (cid:133)nd an equilibrium of any graphical\n",
			"game on a tree, as shown by Littman, Kearns and Singh [?]. Once we venture beyond\n",
			"trees, however, the strong conjecture is that there is no such algorithm with a number of\n",
			"steps that is always polynomial in n (see Daskalakis, Goldberg, Papadimitriou [174]).41\n",
			"Although this is somewhat pessimistic with regards to being able to make predictions\n",
			"of behavior in the broad class of graphical games, there is often much more structure to\n",
			"the games that we are insterested in compared to the worst case scenarios that might\n",
			"tend to lead to high computation time. As we have seen, strategic complementarities\n",
			"make (cid:133)nding equilibria easy and very fast.42\n",

			"41The (cid:147)strong conjecture(cid:148) is based on the fact that the problem of computing Nash equilibria in\n",

			"as a function of actions, and then (ii) using various equilibrium notions to make either\n",
			"descriptive or prescriptive predictions. In framing the analysis, a number of questions\n",
			"become important. First, who are the players? They may be people, (cid:133)rms, organiza-\n",

			"This should include a complete list of all the actions that they might take which could\n",
			"have some impact on the payo\u2044s to anyone involved in the game. Third, what is the\n",

			"or sequentially. Another part of this is whether the interaction is repeated. The order\n",
			"of play will be important in determining who knows what. Moving after another player\n",
			"may give you an advantage of knowing what the other player has done, it may also put\n",
			"you at a disadvantage as you may have lost time and possibly an ability to commit to\n",
			"some action. Embodied in this aspect of the game is also a question of what informa-\n",
			"tion di\u2044erent players have when they take actions. Fourth, what are the payo\u2044s to the\n",
			"various players as a result of the interaction? Ascertaining this will involve estimating\n",

			"example where we end up with the same game as above is what is known as a (cid:147)Cournot\n",
			"duopoly.(cid:148) The story is as follows. Two (cid:133)rms produce identical goods. They each have\n",

			"If they produce at high\n",
			"production, they will have a lot of the good to sell, while at low production they will\n",

			"at low production. In this case, the product is rare and fetches a very high price on\n",
			"the market and they each make a pro(cid:133)t of 4. (cid:147)Defect(cid:148) refers to producing at high\n",
			"production. If they each produce at high production, then they will depress the price\n",
			"and even though they sell more of the goods, the price will drop enough so as to lower\n",
			"their overall pro(cid:133)ts to 2 each. If one defects and the other cooperates, then the price\n",
			"is in a middle range. The (cid:133)rm with the higher production sells more goods and earns\n",
			"a higher pro(cid:133)t of 6, while the (cid:133)rm with the lower production ends up just covering its\n",

			"9.10.2 Dominant Strategies\n",
			"\n",
			"Given a game in normal form, we then can make predictions about which actions will be\n",

			"Dominant strategies are powerful both from an analytical point of view, and from a\n",
			"player(cid:146)s perspective. An individual does not have to make any predictions about what\n",
			"\n",

			"\n",
			"CHAPTER 9. DECISIONS, BEHAVIOR, AND GAMES ON NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"other players might do, and still has a well-de(cid:133)ned best strategy.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the prisoners(cid:146)dilemma, it is easy to check that each player has a strictly dominant\n",
			"strategy to defect - that is to confess to the police and to agree to testify. So, if we\n",
			"use dominant strategies to predict play, then the unique prediction is that each player\n",
			"will defect and both players fair worse than at the alternative strategies where neither\n",
			"defects. A basic lesson from the prisoners(cid:146)dilemma is that individual incentives and\n",
			"overall welfare need not coincide. The players both end up going to jail for 2 years,\n",
			"even though they would have only gone to jail for 1 year if they could have managed\n",
			"not to defect. The problem is that they cannot trust each other to cooperate: no\n",
			"matter what the other player does, a player is best o\u2044 defecting.\n",
			"\n",
			"An important comment is that this analysis presumes that all of the relevant payo\u2044\n",
			"information is included in the payo\u2044 function. If, for instance, a player fears retribution\n",
			"for confessing and testifying, then that should be included in the payo\u2044s and can change\n",
			"the incentives in the game. If the player cares about how many years the other player\n",
			"spends in jail, then that can be written into the payo\u2044 function as well.\n",

			"be best against the actions taken by the other players, and not necessarily against all\n",
			"possible strategies of the other players.\n",
			"\n",
			"A Nash equilibrium has the nice property that it is stable: if each player expects x\n",
			"to be the pro(cid:133)le of strategies played, then no player has any incentive to change his or\n",
			"her action. Another way to put this, is that no player would regret having played the\n",
			"strategy that he or she played in a Nash equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"In some cases, the best response of a player to the strategies of the other players is\n",
			"unique. A Nash equilibrium such that all players are playing strategies that are unique\n",
			"best responses is called a strict Nash equilibrium.\n",
			"\n",
			"A pro(cid:133)le of dominant strategies is a Nash equilibrium, but not vice versa.\n",
			"To see a Nash equilibrium in action, consider the following game between two (cid:133)rms\n",
			"who are choosing whether or not to advertise. Total available pro(cid:133)ts are 28 to be\n",
			"split between the two (cid:133)rms. Advertising costs a (cid:133)rm 8. Firm 1 currently has a larger\n",

			"pro(cid:133)ts. If they both advertise, then they will split the market evenly 14 each, but bear\n",
			"the cost of advertising so they will see pro(cid:133)ts of 6 each. If one advertises, while the\n",
			"other does not, then the advertiser gets three quarters of the market (but also pays for\n",
			"advertising) and the non(cid:150)advertiser sees one quarter of the market. (There are some\n",
			"obvious simpli(cid:133)cations here: just considering two levels of advertising and assuming\n",

			"\n",
			"There is a deep and long-standing debate about how to interpret mixed strategies,\n",

			"links and exactly k players have a link in or out. The cost is at least kc for any such\n",
			"network, which is the cost of a wheel. In order to have at least as high a payo\u2044 as\n",
			"a wheel, it must be that Ri(g) = k (cid:0) 1. Thus, there is a directed cycle containing\n",
			"all k players. If the network is not a wheel, and it contains a directed cycle with k\n",
			"players, it has more than k links, and so leads to a lower payo\u2044 than the k-player\n",
			"wheel. Thus, the only possibilities besides wheels for e\u00a2 cient networks are the empty\n",
			"network and networks that involve k players but have fewer than k links. In the latter\n",
			"case, it must have k (cid:0) 1 links to include k players in a component. Here thus must be\n",
			"a player i who has at least one link in but no links out and another player j who has\n",
			"at least one link out but no links in. Given that it is e\u00a2 cient for j to link to some k\n",
			"(and since j has no links in, only j bene(cid:133)ts from that link), adding a link from i to\n",
			"j would increase payo\u2044s by even more than the link from j to k does on the margin\n",
			"\n",

			"Ri(g) = 0), which is a contradiction.\n",
			"\n",
			"Thus, di\u2044erent wheels (and combinations of wheels) and the empty network are the\n",
			"possible e\u00a2 cient networks. The remainder of the claim is straightforward, noting that\n",
			"if the value of a wheel with less than n players is positive, then the value of a wheel\n",
			"involving all players generates a higher per capita payo\u2044.\n",
			"\n",
			"Next, let us characterize the strictly Nash stable networks.\n",
			"First, in the case where c > n (cid:0) 1 it follows directly that the only (strict) Nash\n",
			"network is the empty network, since a link can lead to a marginal payo\u2044 of at most\n",
			"n (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) c. Next, in a case where 1 < c < n (cid:0) 1, the empty network is still a strict\n",
			"Nash equilibrium, as each link that a player adds will changes that player(cid:146)s payo\u2044 by\n",
			"an amount 1 (cid:0) c < 0. In the case where c < 1 it is clear that the empty network is\n",
			"not Nash stable. The proof is then completed by showing that whenever c < n(cid:0) 1 any\n",
			"nonempty strictly Nash stable network must be a wheel involving all players, as it is\n",
			"clear that such a network is strictly Nash stable.\n",
			"\n",
			"So, let c < n (cid:0) 1 and consider a nonempty strictly Nash stable network. First,\n",
			"note that all players have at out degree of at least one. Suppose not. There is at\n",
			"least one player j who strictly bene(cid:133)ted from a link ij, since the network is nonempty.\n",
			"By duplicating that link, a player with no out links would also strictly bene(cid:133)t, which\n",
			"contradicts equilibrium. Next, note that each player must have at most one link coming\n",
			"in. Suppose to the contrary that players i and j both have links to player k. By deleting\n",
			"the link to k and adding a link to j (or keeping the link to j if i already has one), i(cid:146)s\n",
			"payo\u2044 can only increase as there is still a path to k (and hence to all other players\n",
			"reached through k) and i has not increased the number of links. Thus, i bene(cid:133)ts\n",
			"weakly from such a change and so the network cannot have been a strictly Nash stable\n",
			"network, which is a contradiction. Hence we have a network such that every player has\n",
			"at least one link out and at most one link in, and hence every player has one link in\n",
			"and one link out. This must be a wheel including all players.\n",
			"\n",
			"The strict aspect of equilibrium is a useful device here as it really narrows down\n",
			"the set of stable networks dramatically. Moreover, in some experiments on this sort of\n",
			"model, Callendar and Plott [112] (cid:133)nd evidence that strictness is a useful predictor of\n",
			"behavior. Part of the reason for the predictive power is the absence of any decay (since\n",
			"(cid:14) = 1), which leads to lots of indi\u2044erences over which links form. More generally, when\n",
			"there is decay, many indi\u2044erences are naturally eliminated and a re(cid:133)nement to strict\n",

			"the notion that the players anticipate the further changes along the path and compare\n",
			"the ending network and the current one.\n",
			"\n",
			"Let us say that a network g0 is improving for S relative to g if it is weakly preferred\n",

			"relative to gk.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the case where consecutive networks in the sequence are required to be adjacent,\n",
			"then this is a farsighted analogue of an improving path, while more generally it allows\n",
			"for large coalitional deviations.\n",
			"\n",
			"Now we can say that a network g is farsightedly pairwise stable\n",
			"\n",
			"if there is no\n",
			"farsighted improving path from g to some other network g0, such that each pair of\n",
			"consecutive networks along the sequence are adjacent.\n",

			"Similarly, we can say that a network g is farsightedly strongly stable if there is no\n",

			"farsighted improving path from g to some other network g0.\n",

			"These are both demanding requirements. They re(cid:133)ne the set of pairwise stable\n",

			"stable is necessarily strongly stable. These de(cid:133)nitions require that networks be immune\n",
			"to both immediate deviations and farsighted sequences of deviations of arbitrary length.\n",
			"In the example in Figure 11.1.4 the complete network is farsightedly strongly stable\n",
			"and thus farsightedly pairwise stable. But more generally, such de(cid:133)nitions are di\u00a2 cult\n",

			"links represent economic or business relationships, and transactions are occurring as\n",

			"that the payo\u2044s to a given component depend only on that component(cid:146)s con(cid:133)guration\n",

			"\n",
			"The intuition behind the result is as follows. It is helpful to consider a simple dyad\n",
			"to see the idea. Suppose that if the dyad is formed, player 1 will get a utility of 2\n",

			"a costly one for player 2. There is a total utility of 1 to be had, and so it is e\u00a2 cient\n",
			"for the link to form; however, without any reallocation of value, player 2 would not\n",
			"be willing to form the relationship. Given that player 1 moves (cid:133)rst, the equilibrium\n",
			"here is easy to see: player one states S1 = f2g and sets v1 = 1; and then 2 responds\n",
			"with S2 = f1g and v2 = 0.22 This is the only subgame perfect equilibrium outcome.\n",
			"E\u2044ectively, player 1 pays player 2 a unit of utility in order to form the link. If the\n",
			"player roles were reversed and player 2 moved (cid:133)rst, then player 2 would demand v2 = 1\n",
			"and leave player 1 with no value. The important aspect is that the players are now\n",

			"As an alternative to the above game, Bloch and Jackson [74] suggest a simultaneous\n",

			"The motivation behind this is not that a simultaneous move game is how networks are\n",

			"the resting point of a more open and dynamic process will have to reach an equilibrium\n",
			"point where no player would gain from changing his or her action given the actions of\n",

			"\n",
			"11.7 Weighted Network Formation\n",
			"\n",
			"Most of the strategic network formation literature has looked at discrete linking de-\n",

			"new insights into how relationships form and what incentives players have to maintain\n",
			"e\u00a2 cient relationships. This is illustrated in the following model due to Rogers [537].\n",
			"There is a (cid:133)nite society of n (cid:21) 3 players who form a weighted and directed network.\n",

			"\n",
			"Each player i has some natural intrinsic base utility vi > 0 that would be his or her\n",

			"faced by any given player in the Rogers(cid:146)model is to allocate a given budget of (cid:147)time(cid:148)\n",
			"or (cid:147)e\u2044ort(cid:148) on di\u2044erent relationships. Thus, the problem is solely one of allocating\n",
			"the budget across di\u2044erent relationships, rather than deciding on how much or many\n",
			"relationships to have in total. That is, generally we can think of a network formation\n",
			"problem faced by a player as having two main components: the total quantity of e\u2044ort\n",
			"or relationships to maintain, and how to distribute that across the di\u2044erent relation-\n",
			"ships. The (cid:133)rst part of the problem is missing here and is generally the problematic\n",
			"one. Usually the ine\u00a2 ciency of network formation stems from the fact that a given\n",
			"player does not properly account (with respect to social welfare) for the fact that his\n",
			"or her relationships also generate additional costs or bene(cid:133)ts to others beyond his or\n",
			"her own private bene(cid:133)t. So the player either under or over invests in the total amount\n",
			"of relationships relative to what is socially valuable. The decision faced by players in\n",
			"the Rogers(cid:146)model is solely allocative: Given the (cid:133)xed budget of weight, how should a\n",
			"player spread it around? Here the player wants to spread it in a way that maximizes\n",
			"his or her payo\u2044, and that would also be the same way that would maximize the indi-\n",
			"rect payo\u2044s, since in this model indirect payo\u2044s come through a given player(cid:146)s utility.\n",
			"That is, a player gets utility from his or her neighbors(cid:146)utility, and so whatever makes\n",
			"them happy also makes him or her happy. This points to the second thing which is\n",
			"special about the model. A player gets indirect utility precisely through increases in\n",
			"neighbors(cid:146) utility. To see how this is special, consider a network that has player 1\n",
			"connected to both 2 and 3, who are each connected to player 4. In the Rogers model,\n",
			"\n",
			"\f524CHAPTER 11. GAME-THEORETIC MODELING OF NETWORK FORMATION\n",
			"\n",
			"the bene(cid:133)ts that player 1 obtains from the indirect connection to player 4 come from\n",
			"both the utility that player 2 gets from being connected to 4 (independently of whether\n",
			"3 is connected) and the value that player 3 gets from being connected to player 4 (in-\n",
			"dependently of whether 2 is connected). In many contexts, it might be the that the\n",
			"marginal bene(cid:133)t to player 1 of having a second indirect path to player 4 is lower than\n",
			"the marginal bene(cid:133)t of having the (cid:133)rst path. Finally, there is also symmetry in that\n",
			"all players get the same direct or indirect utility from any given connection, and they\n",
			"do not have any heterogeneity in which connections they would prefer.\n",
			"\n",
			"While this model has special features, and they are responsible for a congruence\n",
			"between equilibrium networks and e\u00a2 cient networks, the model still provides a nice\n",
			"benchmark in terms of understanding the tradeo\u2044s that players face in deciding how\n",
			"to allocate their time or e\u2044ort across di\u2044erent relationships. There are many variations\n",
			"on the model that one might consider, including some by Rogers [537], a model by\n",
			"Brueckner [102] where e\u2044ort translates into the probability that a link forms, and a\n",
			"model by Bloch and Dutta [71] where players do not face a budget constraint.\n",
			"\n",
			"11.8 Agent-Based Modeling\n",
			"\n",
			"When modeling network formation (or behavior on networks, or some combination of\n",
			"the two), a di\u00a2 culty faced is that quite complex networks and/or patterns of behavior\n",
			"can emerge from fairly simple speci(cid:133)cations, especially when even minimal sorts of\n",
			"heterogeneity (geography, age, costs, preference types, etc.) are introduced. Although\n",
			"there are many insights that one can derive analytically, there are some things that\n",
			"cannot be seen so directly. In many cases, it is more expedient to examine the behavior\n",
			"of large computer-simulated societies.\n",
			"\n",
			"Such analyses have become more extensively used in the literature and are often re-\n",
			"ferred to as agent-based modeling. These techniques can be very useful for a variety of\n",

			"to capture a multitude of applications, and yet simple enough to be compact, intuitive,\n",
			"and tractable. As we proceed, I will try to make clear what is being admitted and\n",

			"\n",
			"2.1.2 Graphs and Networks\n",
			"\n",
			"The canonical network form is an undirected graph, where two nodes are either con-\n",

			"with each other or not, but it cannot be that one is related to the second without the\n",
			"second being related to the (cid:133)rst. This is generally true of many social and/or economic\n",
			"relationships, such as partnerships, friendships, alliances, acquaintances, etc. This sort\n",
			"of network will be central to most of the chapters that follow. However, there are\n",
			"other situations that we will examine that are better modeled as directed networks,\n",
			"where one node may be connected to a second without the second being connected to\n",
			"the (cid:133)rst. For instance, a network that keeps track of which authors cite which other\n",
			"authors, or which web pages have links to which others would naturally take the form\n",
			"of a directed graph.\n",
			"\n",
			"The distinction between directed and undirected networks is not a mere technicality.\n",
			"It is fundamental to the analysis, as the applications and modeling are quite di\u2044erent.\n",
			"In particular, when links are necessarily reciprocal, then it will generally be the case\n",
			"that joint consent is needed to establish and/or maintain the relationship. For instance,\n",
			"in order to form a trading partnership, both partners need to agree. To maintain a\n",

			"In the case of directed networks, one individual may direct a link at another\n",
			"without the other(cid:146)s consent, which is generally true in citation networks or in links\n",

			"once. For example, in Figure 2.2.3 both nodes 2 and 3 are in two di\u2044erent cliques.\n",
			"\n",
			"One measure of cliqueshness is to count the number and size of the cliques of\n",

			"\n",
			"Degree Centrality\n",
			"\n",
			"Perhaps the simplest measure of the position of a given node in a network is simply to\n",
			"keep track of its degree. A node with degree n (cid:0) 1 would be directly connected to all\n",
			"other nodes, and hence quite central to the network. A node connected to only 2 other\n",
			"nodes (for large n) would be, at least in one sense, less central. The degree centrality\n",
			"of a node is simply di(g)=(n (cid:0) 1), so that it ranges from 0 to 1 and tells us how well a\n",
			"node is connected, in terms of direct connections.\n",
			"\n",
			"Of course, degree centrality is clearly missing many of the interesting aspects of a\n",
			"network. In particular, it completely misses any aspect of how well located a node is in\n",

			"7). There are several senses in which we see a powerful or central role of node 4.\n",
			"If one deletes node 4, the component structure of the network changes. This might\n",
			"be very important if we are thinking about something like information transmission,\n",
			"where node 4 is critical in path-connecting nodes 1 and 7. This will be picked up by\n",
			"a measure such as betweenness. We also see that node 4 is relatively close to all of\n",
			"the other nodes, in that it is at most two links away from any other node, whereas\n",
			"each other node has at least one node at a distance of three or more. This would be\n",
			"important in applications where something is being conveyed or transmitted through\n",
			"the network (say an opinion or favor) and there is a decay of the strength with distance.\n",
			"In that case, being closer can either help a node make use of other nodes (e.g., having\n",
			"access to favors) or to have in(cid:135)uence (e.g., conveying opinions). This brings us to the\n",

			"next category of centrality measures.\n",
			"\n",
			"Closeness Centrality\n",
			"\n",
			"This second class of measures keeps track of how close a given node is to each other\n",
			"node. One obvious (cid:147)closeness(cid:148)-based measure is just the inverse of the average distance\n",
			"\n",
			"between i and any other node: (n(cid:0) 1)=Pj6=i \u2018(i; j), where \u2018(i; j) is the number of links\n",
			"\n",
			"in the shortest path between i and j. There are various conventions for handling\n",
			"networks that are not connected, as well as other possible measures of distance, which\n",
			"leads to a whole family of closeness measures.\n",
			"\n",
			"A richer way of measuring centrality based on closeness is to consider a decay\n",
			"parameter (cid:14), where 1 > (cid:14) > 0 and then consider the proximity between a given node\n",
			"and each other node weighted by the decay. In particular, let the decay centrality of a\n",

			"where \u2018(i; j) is set to in(cid:133)nity if i and j are not path-connected. This is a centrality\n",
			"measure that is related to the symmetric connections model of Jackson and Wolinsky\n",
			"[343], as it is just the bene(cid:133)t that a node gets in that model of a network.\n",
			"\n",
			"As (cid:14) gets close to one, it is easy to see that decay centrality measures how large a\n",
			"component a node lies in. As (cid:14) gets close to 0, then decay centrality gives in(cid:133)nitely\n",
			"more weight to closer nodes than farther nodes, so it becomes proportional to degree\n",
			"centrality. For intermediate values of (cid:14), a node is rewarded for how close it is to other\n",
			"nodes, but in a way that very distant nodes are weighted less than closer nodes.\n",
			"\n",
			"Betweenness Centrality\n",
			"\n",
			"A measure of centrality that is based on how well situated a node is in terms of the\n",
			"paths that it lies on, was (cid:133)rst proposed by Freeman [237], and we (cid:133)rst discussed it in\n",

			"of the more elegant, both mathematically and in terms of the ideas that it captures, is\n",
			"a notion developed by Bonacich [84]. Bonacich(cid:146)s measure is based on ideas that trace\n",

			"This follows since if the minimum degree is n=2 then the smallest component has more\n",

			"then by starting with an omitted neighbor of i and then moving to i, we could (cid:133)nd a\n",

			"least one of the nodes on the path that is a neighbor of i, say k, must have the previous\n",
			"node on the path be a neighbor of j. Thus, consider the cycle formed as follows: ik,\n",
			"k + 1 : : : j, j k(cid:0) 1, k(cid:0) 2 : : : i (where the : : : correspond to the original path). The claim\n",
			"is that this is a Hamilton cycle. If this cycle does not include all nodes, then since the\n",
			"network is connected there is some node outside of the cycle connected to some node\n",
			"in the cycle. Then it is possible to make a path including that node and all nodes in\n",
			"the cycle, which contradicts the fact that the original path was of maximal length.\n",

			"15 Gaussian Financial Markets\n",
			"\n",
			"Buy low or when the price is rising?\n",
			"\n",
			"In a CARA\u2013Gauss setting, the demand for the asset is similar to the de-\n",
			"mand for investment in a quadratic model, with the important difference\n",
			"that the cost is endogenous to the information revealed by others. Two\n",
			"models of trade are considered: (i) limit orders are net demand sched-\n",
			"ules, which are contingent on the information revealed by the price;\n",
			"social learning does not slow down when more agents trade; (ii) market\n",
			"orders specify \ufb01xed quantities (rationally determined); social learning\n",
			"slows down by the same mechanism as in the model of Vives (1993) in\n",
			"Chapter 3.\n",
			"\n",
			"In this chapter, a \ufb01nancial market is modeled according to a standard structure: a\n",
			"large number of agents, each with a net demand curve, meet the market, and an\n",
			"auctioneer clears the market with an equilibrium price. The structure of the CARA\u2013\n",
			"Gauss model is based on a utility with constant absolute risk aversion of agents and\n",
			"Gaussian random variables. It is presented here from \ufb01rst principles. This model has\n",
			"been studied extensively because of its nice properties.1 The purpose of this chapter is\n",
			"to relate some of the properties of the CARA\u2013Gauss model to other models of social\n",
			"learning in this book.\n",
			"\n",
			"INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS\n",
			"In previous chapters, actions conveyed private informations to others. In a \ufb01nancial\n",
			"market, these actions are the trades. Section 15.1 emphasizes how the information of\n",
			"an agent about the value of an asset (the unobservable state of the world) affects his\n",
			"demand for the asset.\n",
			"\n",
			"We saw in Chapter 3 that if the precision of the public information increases (for\n",
			"example through history), an agent\u2019s action depends less on his private signal and\n",
			"\n",
			"1 A few references in the abundant literature: Admati (1985), Kyle (1985, 1989).\n",
			"\n",
			"330\n",
			"\n",
			"\fGaussian Financial Markets\n",
			"\n",
			"331\n",
			"\n",
			"more on the public information. This is an important mechanism in the slowing\n",
			"down of social learning when the action is subject to a noise. Such a reduction does\n",
			"not operate when the action is the demand by a CARA agent: as it is highlighted here,\n",
			"the reduction of the impact on the expected value of the asset operates as before; but\n",
			"the better precision of the public information reduces the risk of the agent, and his\n",
			"demand is more sensitive to changes in the expected value of the asset. One of the\n",
			"beauties of the CARA\u2013Gauss model is that the two effects cancel each other exactly.\n",
			"\n",
			"MARKETS AND INFORMATION\n",
			"All models in this chapter describe a market for a single risky asset where individuals\n",
			"allocate their portfolio between the risky asset and a riskless asset. The risky asset has\n",
			"a value \u03b8, which is drawn from a normal distribution N (\u03b8, \u03c3\u03b8 ) and is not directly\n",
			"observable. In all models, there are three types of traders:\n",
			"\n",
			"\u2022 Informed agents have private information on \u03b8 (as in the previous chapters). The\n",
			"type of the private information will vary from model to model. The informed\n",
			"agents maximize a utility function. It turns out that when the random asset has a\n",
			"normal distribution, the maximization of the expected utility with CARA generates\n",
			"a simple demand function. This demand function will be linear in the private signal\n",
			"of an agent and thus be very similar to the actions of agents in Chapter 2. We have\n",
			"seen that Bayesian learning from others is linear when the distributions are normal\n",
			"and the decision functions of others are linear. Such nice properties are just too\n",
			"tempting. Although the assumption of absolute risk aversion is debatable (the\n",
			"assumption of normality of the returns has also been questioned), we will use it\n",
			"shamelessly in this chapter, which presents standard results. Later, we will see that\n",
			"some of these results are robust to utility functions that are not CARA.\n",
			"\n",
			"\u2022 Uninformed agents do not have any private signal and rely only on the public\n",
			"information generated by the market. They trade because they have a degree of\n",
			"risk aversion different from that of the informed agents. (A smaller degree of risk\n",
			"aversion is plausible but not necessary.)\n",
			"\n",
			"\u2022 Noise traders simply buy or sell a \ufb01xed quantity, say for a private motive that is not\n",
			"\n",
			"related to the return \u03b8 of the asset. Their net demand is random.\n",
			"\n",
			"Following the standard procedure, we assume that agents place limit orders: each\n",
			"agent brings to the market his entire demand schedule. Let X I ( p) be the total net\n",
			"demand of the asset by all informed traders (who may have different private informa-\n",
			"tion). The uninformed agents bring their demand schedule, XU ( p), which depends\n",
			"only on p, and the noise traders bring their exogenous demand, Q. The total demand\n",
			"schedule is the sum of the three: X I ( p) + XU ( p) + Q. An auctioneer takes the total\n",
			"net demand and determines the price p that clears the market, i.e., the solution of the\n",
			"equilibrium equation\n",
			"\n",
			"(15.1)\n",
			"\n",
			"X I ( p) + XU ( p) + Q = 0.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f332\n",
			"\n",
			"Gaussian Financial Markets\n",
			"\n",
			"The price conveys a signal on the information of the informed traders. The signal\n",
			"is noisy because of the noise traders. When an agent speci\ufb01es a demand x( p), he\n",
			"formulates his demand conditional on p being an equilibrium price and conveying\n",
			"some information (on the value of the asset). Hence, after trade actually takes place\n",
			"at the price p, no rational agent would want to revise his order.\n",
			"\n",
			"The extraction of the agents\u2019 information through the market equilibrium price\n",
			"is presented in two steps (Section 15.2). First, it is assumed that all agents with pri-\n",
			"vate information have the same information. In this way, one concentrates on the\n",
			"transmission of this information to uninformed agents through the market. In the\n",
			"second step, informed agents have heterogeneous private information. Their actions\n",
			"are therefore determined both by their private information and by the equilibrium\n",
			"price, which depends on their actions. Fortunately, the learning rules in a Gaussian\n",
			"model are linear (Chapter 3), and the solution of the model is similar to that of\n",
			"standard models of rational expectations.\n",
			"\n",
			"Special attention is devoted to the elasticity of the demand, which may affect the\n",
			"stability of the market and the existence of multiple equilibria. If the price rises, the\n",
			"\ufb01rst effect is a smaller demand, as in any market. However, the higher price is also inter-\n",
			"preted by uninformed agents as an indication that informed agents may be buying be-\n",
			"cause of good news. The second effect dampens the \ufb01rst one: the demand is less elastic.\n",
			"In the next two sections, we focus on two issues: the convergence of beliefs and\n",
			"\n",
			"the \ufb02uctuations of the prices and demand.\n",
			"\n",
			"LIMIT AND MARKET ORDERS, AND CONVERGENCE OF BELIEFS\n",
			"In the standard situation, the market has a unique equilibrium and a sequence of\n",
			"market equilibria induces a process of learning, which converges to the truth \u2013 but\n",
			"how fast? This issue is addressed in Section 15.3, and the answer depends on the type\n",
			"of the orders for trade.\n",
			"\n",
			"As stated above, a higher precision of public information has no effect on the\n",
			"multiplier of the agent\u2019s signal in his demand. Because of this neutrality, there is\n",
			"no slowing down of social learning in the CARA\u2013Gauss model if agents place limit\n",
			"orders: the precision of the public information increases linearly with the number of\n",
			"observations.\n",
			"\n",
			"Market orders are placed by informed agents before the opening of the market and\n",
			"are speci\ufb01ed as \ufb01xed quantities of net purchases. An order depends on the expectations\n",
			"of the informed traders about the equilibrium price. It does not, however, depend\n",
			"on the realization of this price, and it has to be executed at some equilibrium price.\n",
			"Someone has to clear the market, however: the uninformed traders and the noise\n",
			"traders are assumed to post a demand schedule, as in the previous case, and the\n",
			"equilibrium price is such that the total net demand is equal to zero.\n",
			"\n",
			"Because the orders of informed traders are \ufb01xed quantities instead of demand\n",
			"schedules, they may convey less information. In addition, the agents face the uncer-\n",
			"tainty of the actual trading price. It turns out that the \ufb01rst issue does not matter, but\n",
			"the second one is critical. Vives (1995) has shown that there is no reduction of the rate\n",
			"\n",
			"\f15.1 Actions in the CARA--Gauss Model\n",
			"\n",
			"333\n",
			"\n",
			"of convergence if the uninformed agents are risk-neutral. In this case, they are able\n",
			"to absorb completely the price \ufb02uctuations induced by the noise traders, and the in-\n",
			"formed agents do not face a trading risk. When the number of observations increases,\n",
			"the reduction of the risk associated with higher public information operates as in the\n",
			"case of limit orders, and the growth of the public information\u2019s precision is linear.\n",
			"\n",
			"If uninformed agents are risk-averse, then the informed agents face an uncertainty\n",
			"about the trading price because of the variance induced by the noise traders. The\n",
			"trading price does not vanish when the precision of the public information increases.\n",
			"The reduction of the multiplier of private information in the private demand (with the\n",
			"higher public information) operates fully now. The situation is isormorphic to that of\n",
			"Vives (1993). The convergence to the truth is slow: the variance of the public estimate\n",
			"tends to zero like 1/n1/3, where n is the number of observations.\n",
			"\n",
			"MULTIPLE EQUILIBRIA\n",
			"Large and sudden variations of the price without any strong news are sometimes\n",
			"interpreted as manifestations of \u201cherds\u201d or irrationality. However, they may be mere\n",
			"examples of multiple equilibria and jumps between these equilibria. The crash of\n",
			"October 1987 has led to many postmortems that are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n",
			"As an introduction, the model of Genotte and Leland (1990) is presented in Section\n",
			"15.4. The model adds to the standard agents, who trade with respect to their expec-\n",
			"tations about the fundamental, another type of agents, the \u201cprice traders,\u201d with a\n",
			"net demand that is an increasing function of the price. This demand is justi\ufb01ed by\n",
			"a trading strategy of portfolio insurance. If the standard agents know the strategy of\n",
			"the price traders, they are able to factor it out and there is a unique equilibrium, as\n",
			"in the standard model. However, if the standard agents have ex ante a low assessment\n",
			"of the probability that price traders intervene in the market, whereas their mass is\n",
			"actually large, then there can be multiple equilibria and sudden price jumps between\n",
			"these equilibria.\n",

			"So far in this chapter, informed agents have placed bids in the \ufb01nancial market in the\n",
			"form of limit orders, which are demand schedules. This section presents the work of\n",
			"Vives (1995), which analyzes the effect of market orders on the convergence of the\n",
			"beliefs. An order with a \ufb01xed quantity to trade seems a priori a coarser signal to others\n",
			"than a limit order, which conveys a demand schedule. More importantly, informed\n",
			"agents will face an additional uncertainty on their return due to the uncertain transac-\n",
			"tion price. This uncertainty might reduce their trade in the market and therefore the\n",
			"amount of information they convey by their trading. Whether this uncertainty matters\n",
			"and slows down social learning depends on the existence of risk-neutral arbitrageurs.\n",
			"The argument is \ufb01rst presented informally.\n",
			"\n",
			"An Informal Presentation\n",
			"The t\u02c6atonnement is the same as above. We will see that the market order by an in-\n",
			"formed agent is of the form\n",

			"\n",
			",\n",
			"\n",
			"where the expectation and the variance are conditional on the information of the\n",
			"agent, but cannot depend on the market price p, which is not observed at the time\n",
			"the order is placed. There are two cases.\n",
			"\n",
			"(i) Assume \ufb01rst that the uninformed traders are risk-neutral. As the number of\n",
			"rounds increases, the fundamental uncertainty converges to zero and the arbi-\n",
			"trageurs assign most of the variations of the order \ufb02ow (informed agents plus\n",
			"noise traders) to the noise traders. Because they smooth out the variations at-\n",
			"tributed to the noise, the variation of the price converges to zero over time. The\n",
			"demand for limit orders by the informed agents is asymptotically the same as for\n",
			"market orders, and the convergence properties of the beliefs are asymptotically\n",
			"the same for the two types of trades.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f15.3 The Convergence of Beliefs\n",
			"\n",
			"347\n",

			"(ii) Assume now that uninformed agents are risk-averse. They do not insure com-\n",
			"pletely against the uncertainty that is due to the noise traders. Asymptotically, the\n",
			"variance of the return on investment remains above a strictly positive number.\n",
			"The demand of the informed agents is then driven by the numerator in (15.33),\n",
			"i.e., by their expectation of the fundamental \u03b8. This demand is mixed with that\n",
			"of the noise traders with constant variance. We are in the same situation as in\n",
			"the model of Vives (1993) described in Chapter 2. Social learning converges to\n",
			"the truth, but the variance of the estimator tends to zero like n1/3, where n is the\n",
			"number of market observations.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the case of limit orders, the precision of the market does not slow down social\n",
			"learning, because the reduction of the effect of private information on the numerator\n",
			"of the demand is exactly compensated by the reduction of the variance in the de-\n",
			"nominator (Section 15.1.1). When the uninformed are risk-neutral in a market with\n",
			"market orders, the variance of an order\u2019s return does not converge to zero, and no\n",

			"rational agents were also based on the price of the asset. For a rational trader, a high\n",
			"price is a signal of higher intrinsic value (because the price is boosted by some in-\n",

			"The Case of Increasing Demand by the Price Traders\n",
			"Assume now that the demand is increasing in the price because of the insurance motive\n",
			"that was described in the introduction. The supply S( p) = \u2212D( p) is declining in p.\n",
			"When the supply is very inelastic (with a negative slope), the equilibrium mechanism\n",
			"is the same as in the previous case. The negative supply ampli\ufb01es the price variations,\n",
			"and therefore the demand of the uninformed agents is more elastic.\n",
			"\n",
			"Assume now that the supply curve has for some range a negative elasticity with a\n",
			"large absolute value. Such a case is represented in the right panel of Figure 15.3. The\n",
			"schedule (X) has two intersections a and b with the supply curve (the middle point is\n",
			"excluded as unstable). The information contents of the prices pa and pb are identical.\n",
			"Both prices reveal the same shift of the demand curve, i.e., the same market variable\n",
			"z, as de\ufb01ned in (15.47). The slope of the segment ab is de\ufb01ned by the price effect on\n",
			"the demand of the rational agents for the given information. From equation (15.48),\n",
			"this slope is \u22121/VarI (\u03b8) \u2212 A.\n",
			"\n",
			"Because the supply is monotonic, the price reveals the market variable z perfectly.\n",
			"(When S( p) is nonmonotonic, an equilibrium price may correspond to different\n",
			"demand curves. In order to discriminate between them, the rational traders have to\n",
			"observe the effective supply of the price traders.)\n",
			"\n",
			"Each price is determined by the intersection of the demand schedule (X) (which\n",
			"is shifted by z) with the supply schedule (S). These intersections must be on one of\n",
			"the two branches along the supply schedule with prices p \u2265 p and p \u2264 p (see Figure\n",
			"15.3). There is no equilibrium point between the two branches.12 Suppose that a\n",
			"shock shifts the demand curve (X) gradually downward. The price responds \ufb01rst by\n",
			"a gradual reduction. For some value of z, however, the equilibrium point necessarily\n",
			"jumps to the lower branch, and a crash occurs at that moment. As usual with multiple\n",
			"equilibria, the crash may occur before the gradual shift forces the equilibrium point\n",
			"to jump to the lower branch. The selection of the equilibrium is obviously beyond\n",
			"the scope of the present model.\n",
			"\n",
			"NONPERCEIVED PRICE TRADERS\n",
			"Suppose that with probability \u03c0 there is a supply S( p) by price traders, and with\n",

			"\n",
			"The demand schedule (X) is less elastic than in the previous case, and multiple\n",

			"Suppose a negative shock affects z. The price falls. Because of insurance trading, price\n",
			"traders sell, and this ampli\ufb01es the shock. Uninformed traders attribute the large fall to\n",
			"bad news about the fundamentals (they do not think about insurance selling). They\n",
			"reduce the demand more. For some shock, the market clearing may require a large\n",

			"We close this section with a \ufb01nal note on the model of Genotte and Leland. Their\n",

			"to generate a very inelastic demand schedule (X) (with more possibilities for multiple\n",
			"equilibria). Informed agents are of two types: \u03b8-agents have a private signal on \u03b8, and\n",
			"each private signal is independent of that of others. The demand of the noise traders\n",
			"is the sum of two independent variables, Q + \u03b7; and Q is observed by the Q-agents\n",
			"(who have all the same signal). As in the other models, there is a third type of rational\n",
			"agents, the uninformed. Such a model can produce a fairly inelastic demand because\n",
			"of the Q-agents. For these agents, the market can be very informative. (If \u03b7 is nil,\n",
			"the market is perfectly informative for them.) A price increase shifts their demand\n",
			"signi\ufb01cantly. These agents do not receive any signal on \u03b8, but they may be much better\n",

			"\n",
			"3.1 The Prevalence of Social Networks\n",
			"\n",
			"Social relationships play a critical role not only in day-to-day life and behavior, but\n",
			"also in determining long run welfare. They a\u2044ect the opinions that we hold and the\n",
			"information that we see, and are also often the key to accessing resources. While this\n",
			"is self-evident and gives sociology its foundation, quantifying the extent to which social\n",
			"relationships play roles in various aspects of life is an illuminating exercise.\n",
			"\n",
			"One of the most robust and well-studied roles of social networks is in obtaining\n",
			"employment. There have been a number of studies of how social contacts matter in\n",
			"obtaining information about job openings. Such studies began in the late 1940(cid:146)s and\n",
			"there is now a rich base of information on this subject.3 One of the earliest studies,\n",
			"by Myers and Shultz [472], was based on interviews with textile workers. They found\n",
			"that 62 percent had found out about and applied to their (cid:133)rst job through a social\n",
			"contact, in contrast with only 23 percent who applied by direct application, and the\n",
			"remaining 15 percent who found their job through an agency, ads, etc. A study by Rees\n",
			"and Shultz [531] showed that these numbers were not particular to textile workers, but\n",
			"applied very broadly. For instance, the percentage of those interviewed who found their\n",
			"jobs through the use of social contacts as a function of their profession was: typist 37.3\n",
			"percent, accountant 23.5 percent, material handler 73.8 percent, janitor 65.5 percent,\n",
			"and electrician 57.4 percent. Moreover, the prevalent use of social contacts in (cid:133)nding\n",
			"jobs is robust across race and gender.4\n",
			"\n",
			"2There are authors, such as Watts [620] and Newman [480], who have looked across (a few) case\n",
			"\n",
			"studies to suggest some common features.\n",
			"\n",
			"3For a recent overview of research on social networks in labor markets see Ioannides and Loury [?].\n",

			"The role of social networks is not unique to labor markets, but has been documented\n",
			"much more extensively. For example, networks and social interactions play a role in\n",
			"crime: Reiss [533], [534] (cid:133)nds that two thirds of criminals commit crimes with others,\n",
			"and Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman [?] (cid:133)nd that social interaction is important\n",
			"in determining criminal activity, especially with respect to petty crime, youth activity\n",
			"in crime, and in areas with less intact households. Networks have also been studied\n",
			"with regards to various markets: Uzzi [598] (cid:133)nds that relation speci(cid:133)c knowledge is\n",
			"critical in the garment industry and he documents how social networks play a key role\n",
			"in that industry; and Weisbuch, Kirman, Herreiner [626] study repeated interactions in\n",
			"the Marseille (cid:133)sh market and discuss the importance of the network structure. Social\n",
			"networks also serve a vital role in the provision of social insurance. For instance,\n",
			"Fafchamps and Lund [221] show that social networks are critical to the understanding\n",
			"of risk-sharing in rural Philippines, and De Weerdt [176] analyzes risk-sharing in parts\n",
			"of Africa. The set of case studies is much more extensive than this list indicates, and\n",

			"of language and culture, in the collaboration on scienti(cid:133)c research and invention, in\n",

			"\n",
			"The stylized fact that large social networks exhibit features of (cid:147)small worlds(cid:148) (see\n",

			"\n",
			"tend to have small diameter and small average path length.6\n",
			"\n",
			"Stanley Milgram [444] pioneered the study of path length through a clever experi-\n",
			"ment where people had to route a letter to another person who was not directly known\n",
			"to them. Letters were distributed to subjects in Kansas and Nebraska, who were told\n",
			"the name, profession, and some approximate residential details about a (cid:147)target(cid:148)person\n",
			"who lived in Massachusetts. The subjects were asked to pass the letter on to someone\n",
			"whom they knew well and would be likely to know the target or to be able to pass it\n",
			"on to someone else, etc., with the objective of getting the letter to the target. While\n",
			"roughly a quarter of the letters reached their targets, the median number of hops for a\n",
			"letter to reach a target was 5 and the maximum was 12. Given that the letters should\n",
			"not be expected to have taken the shortest path, this is a startlingly small number. In\n",
			"addition, given the chains of interactions needed to get a letter from an initial subject\n",
			"to the target, the fact that a quarter of the letters reached their targets is also an\n",
			"impressive (cid:133)gure, especially in light of the fact that response rates in many voluntary\n",
			"surveys are on the order of twenty to thirty percent.7\n",
			"\n",
			"To get some feeling for why many social networks exhibit small diameters, it is useful\n",
			"to think about neighborhood sizes. Most people have thousands of acquaintances.\n",
			"Depending on whether one keeps track of strong relationships or casual acquaintances,\n",
			"this might vary from the order of tens or hundreds to the order of thousands for a typical\n",
			"adult in a developed country (e.g., see Pool and Kochen [518], which is a key early\n",
			"study of small worlds). If we take a conservative estimate that a given individual has\n",
			"100 relatives, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances with whom they are in somewhat\n",
			"regular contact, then we end up with a very rough calculation (ignoring clustering\n",
			"and treating the network as if it were a tree) of 1002 or 10,000 friends of friends, and\n",
			"1 million friends of friends of friends. By the time we move out four links, we have\n",
			"covered a nontrivial portion of most countries. While this overestimates the reach of\n",
			"a network since it treats the network like a tree and ignores the clustering exhibited\n",
			"in most networks, it still provides a feeling for orders of magnitude. If we count more\n",
			"casual acquaintances, and use a (cid:133)gure on the order of 1000 acquaintances per person,\n",
			"then a tree network reaches a million nodes within a path distance of two and reaches\n",
			"\n",
			"6See Watts [620] for more discussion. This stylized fact is captured in the famous (cid:147)six degrees\n",
			"of separation(cid:148) of John Gaure(cid:146)s play, and actually dates to a 1929 play called (cid:147)Chains(cid:148) by Frigyes\n",

			"7This study has been replicated and extended a number of times. A recent example is research by\n",

			"represents the co-authorship of a paper during some time period covered by the study.\n",
			"The well-known and proli(cid:133)c mathematician Paul Erd(cid:246)s had many co-authors, and as a\n",

			"in such networks in terms of how they grow. 8 These networks are of scienti(cid:133)c interest\n",
			"themselves, as they tell us something about how research is conducted and also how\n",

			"\n",
			"Here we see that despite the non-comparabilities of the networks along some dimen-\n",

			"measures much larger than would arise if the network were generated at random. For\n",
			"instance, let us re-consider the networks of researchers that have been analyzed in\n",
			"various (cid:133)elds of study. For instance, Newman [480] reports overall clustering coe\u00a2 cients\n",
			"of 0.496 for computer science, and 0.45 for physics, while Grossman [298] reports an\n",
			"overall coe\u00a2 cient of 0.15 in mathematics. To get an idea of how this compares with\n",
			"the clustering that would appear in a purely random network, let us consider the\n",
			"physics network which has 52,909 nodes and an average degree of 9.27. A purely\n",
			"random network that had this average degree would have a probability of any given\n",
			"link forming of 9:27=52908, or roughly .00018. For such a purely random network, the\n",
			"chance that link ik is present when ij and jk are present is simply the probability that\n",
			"ik is present, which is then .00018. This tells us that the clustering of .45 is roughly\n",
			"2500 times greater than the clustering we would see in a random network of the same\n",
			"size and connectivity. We can also examine analogous numbers for a similar network\n",
			"constructed for researchers in economics. The data of Goyal, van der Leij, and Moroga-\n",
			"Gonzalez [286] covering papers published in economics journals in the 1970(cid:146)s has a total\n",
			"of 33770 nodes and an average degree of .894.12 The clustering they report for that\n",
			"network is .193, whereas the corresponding clustering for a purely random network of\n",
			"the same degree is on the order of .894/33770 or .000026. Here the observed clustering\n",
			"is almost 10000 times larger than in the random network.13\n",
			"\n",
			"Similarly high clustering has been observed in a variety of other contexts. For\n",
			"example, Watts [620] reports a clustering coe\u00a2 cient of 0:79 for the network consisting\n",
			"of movie actors linked by movies in which they have co-starred. Several studies have\n",
			"also analyzed clustering in the world wide web. Adamic [1] gives a clustering measure\n",
			"of 0.1078 on the world wide web data set mentioned in Section ??. To get a feeling for\n",
			"how large this clustering measure is, note that we expect a purely random graph with\n",
			"the same number of links to have a clustering coe\u00a2 cient of 0.00023, so that the observed\n",
			"network has about 469 times more clustering than if links were formed independently.\n",

			"\n",
			"13Note in such collaboration networks, as there may be many co-authors on any given paper,\n",
			"clustering in this particular application partly re(cid:135)ects the fact that a multi-co-authored paper provides\n",
			"a complete set of connections between the authors. Given large numbers of co-authors per paper in\n",

			"The network of reported friendships among prison inmates of MacRae [422] shows\n",

			"\n",
			"22Even a (cid:133)nite network where links are formed completely independently, there can be correlation\n",
			"in degrees. For instance, consider the simplest possible setting with just two nodes, and where the\n",
			"probability of a link is 1/2. Here the degree of the two nodes is perfectly correlated, as they either\n",
			"both have degree 1 or both have degree 0. So, even when links are formed independently, the fact\n",

			"\n",
			"Related to assortativity, studies of some social networks have also suggested (cid:147)core-\n",
			"periphery(cid:148)patterns (e.g., see Brass [?]), where there is a core of highly connected and\n",
			"interconnected nodes, and then a periphery of less connected nodes. Moreover, theories\n",
			"of structural similarity posit that people tend to use other people who are similar to\n",
			"themselves as a reference group (Festinger [?]). Studies building from this hypothesis\n",
			"(e.g., Burt [105]) have found that people with similar structural positions tend to have\n",

			"\n",
			"As the patterns of connections in a network can have a profound impact on things\n",
			"like the di\u2044usion of behavior, information, or disease, it is important to develop a better\n",
			"understanding of assortativity and other characteristics that describe who tends to be\n",
			"connected to whom in a network.\n",
			"\n",
			"3.2.5 Patterns of Clustering\n",
			"\n",
			"There are other patterns in networks that help characterize overall structure. Beyond\n",
			"degree distributions and correlations in degrees, one can also examine how clustering is\n",
			"distributed across a network. Clustering measures such as average or overall clustering\n",
			"are simple summary statistics. While they give some insight, we can look at much\n",
			"more detailed information about how clustering varies throughout a network.\n",
			"\n",
			"For instance, in the example of the Florentine marriages, we can keep track of the\n",
			"full distribution of individual clustering coe\u00a2 cients across nodes. In that network there\n",
			"are nine nodes with clustering coe\u00a2 cients of 0, (cid:133)ve nodes with clustering coe\u00a2 cients of\n",
			"1/3, one node with a clustering coe\u00a2 cient of 2/3, and one with a clustering coe\u00a2 cient\n",
			"\n",
			"24Their network has a directed link from one country to another if the (cid:133)rst exports to the second.\n",
			"The relationship they examine is similar whether or not one examines outdegree, indegree, an undi-\n",
			"rected version (with a link if there is a directed link in either direction), and a di\u2044erent undirected\n",
			"version where one only examines reciprocal links (where there are directed links both ways).\n",
			"\n",
			"\f3.2. OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"99\n",
			"\n",
			"of 1/15.\n",
			"It is perhaps even more informative to see how the clustering relates to\n",
			"the degree of a node.\n",
			"In the Florentine Marriage example, all nodes with degree\n",
			"two or less have individual clustering coe\u00a2 cients of 0. Degree three nodes have on\n",
			"average a clustering of 4/15 (one has 0 and four have 1/3), degree four nodes have\n",
			"on average a clustering of 1/6 (one has 2/6 and the other 0), and the degree six node\n",
			"has a clustering of 1/15. Here there is some pattern. First, the low degree nodes\n",
			"have clusterings of 0, most simply by convention. But more interestingly, the rate of\n",
			"clustering among the higher degree nodes is decreasing in the degree. This sort of\n",
			"pattern has been noted in other applications as well. That is, the neighbors of a higher\n",
			"degree node are less likely to be linked to each other as compared to the neighbors of\n",
			"a lower degree node. For example, Goyal, van der Leij, and Moraga-Gonz\u00c6lez [286]\n",
			"observe that a network of co-authorship among 81217 economists in the 1990(cid:146)s had\n",
			"an overall clustering coe\u00a2 cient of .157, while averaging over the one hundred nodes\n",
			"with the highest degrees only yielded an average clustering of .043. Thus, the highest\n",
			"degree nodes tend to exhibit lower clustering than one sees on average across the whole\n",
			"network. A very simple way to see if a network might exhibit such a pattern is to\n",
			"compare the overall clustering to the average clustering. Overall clustering can be\n",
			"thought of a weighted averaging of clustering across nodes with weights proportional\n",
			"to the number of pairs of neighbors that the nodes have (so the weight on node i\n",
			"is di(di (cid:0) 1)=2)), while average clustering weights all nodes equally. Thus, overall\n",
			"clustering is weighting the higher degree nodes much more than average clustering is,\n",
			"and so if the overall clustering is signi(cid:133)cantly lower than the average clustering, then\n",
			"there is a sense in which the clustering is relatively lower for higher degree nodes. We\n",
			"can see this by comparing the overall clustering numbers for the networks reported\n",
			"in Table ?? to the average clustering numbers for the same networks. For instance,\n",
			"the ratios of overall clustering to average clustering are .09/.60 for biology, .15/.34\n",
			"for math, and .45/.56 physics.25 We can also simply examine the correlation between\n",
			"degree and the clustering in a node(cid:146)s neighborhood. Jackson and Rogers [337] calculate\n",
			"such correlations for the prison and ham radio networks mentioned above. They (cid:133)nd\n",
			"a correlation of -.05 between a node(cid:146)s in-degree and the clustering in its neighborhood\n",
			"for MacRae(cid:146)s [422] friendship network among prison inmates, and a correlation of -\n",
			".27 between a node(cid:146)s degree and the clustering in its neighborhood for Killworth and\n",
			"Bernard(cid:146)s [372] Ham radio network. However, these are both small networks and so\n",
			"\n",
			"25The number is not reported in the economics co- authorship data set, but we already saw some\n",
			"\n",
			"aspect of this relationship in that network, as discussed above.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f100CHAPTER 3. EMPIRICAL BACKGROUND ON SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"neither of these (cid:133)gures is statistically signi(cid:133)cant and are thus only suggestive.\n",
			"\n",
			"It is not obvious whether this is a general pattern of social and/or other forms of\n",
			"networks, but it is at least exhibited in some observed networks, and is something that\n",
			"we will see exhibited by some models of network formation.\n",
			"\n",
			"3.2.6 Homophily\n",
			"\n",
			"Many social networks exhibit what is was named (cid:147)homophily(cid:148)by Lazarsfeld and Mer-\n",
			"ton [404]. As we saw in Section 1.2.2, this refers to the fact that people are more prone\n",
			"to maintain relationships with people who are similar to themselves. This applies very\n",
			"broadly, as measured by age, race, gender, religion, profession and is generally a quite\n",
			"strong and robust observation (see McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Cook [439] for an\n",
			"overview of research on homophily). It was (cid:133)rst noted by Burton [108] who coined the\n",
			"phrase (cid:147)birds of a feather.(cid:148) For example, based on a national survey Marsden [429]\n",
			"(cid:133)nds that only 8 percent of people have any people of another race with whom they\n",
			"(cid:147)discuss important matters.(cid:148) Homophily is an important aspect of social networks\n",
			"since it means that some social networks may be largely segregated. This, for instance,\n",
			"has profound implications in the access to job information (e.g., see Calv(cid:243)-Armengol\n",
			"and Jackson [119]). It can also have profound implications for the spread of other sorts\n",
			"of information, behaviors, and so forth.\n",
			"\n",
			"There is an important distinction between di\u2044erent forms of homophily. One is due\n",
			"solely to opportunity, while the other is due to choice. For instance, it is not surprising\n",
			"that most children have closest friends who are of a similar age as themselves. Much of\n",
			"this is due to the fact that they form friendships with other children with whom they\n",
			"regularly interact at school. This is the aspect that it is due to opportunity, which\n",
			"is constrained by the structure of classes within schools, among other things. Beyond\n",
			"this, even when presented with opportunities to form ties across age, there is still a\n",
			"tendency to form a disproportionate fraction with own-age individuals. This has been\n",
			"attributed to a number of factors including maturity and interests. One also sees this\n",
			"with respect to other factors such as race. For example, in middle school, less than 10\n",
			"percent of (cid:147)expected(cid:148)cross-race friendships exist (Shrum et al [?]). That is, given the\n",
			"composition of schools in terms of race, if individuals form relationships in proportion\n",
			"to the relative numbers of people of various races that they encounter, there should\n",
			"be ten times more cross-race relationships than are observed. Thus, in addition to the\n",
			"substantial homophily one would expect due to the fact that most schools are biased\n",
			"in their racial composition and thus there is a bias in opportunity towards own-race\n",
			"\n",
			"\f3.2. OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF NETWORKS\n",
			"\n",
			"101\n",
			"\n",
			"relationships, one also sees a very strong own-race bias in the relationships formed\n",
			"beyond that governed by relative population sizes.\n",
			"\n",
			"To get a better impression of homophily, consider Table 3.4, which describes the\n",

			"[290]. He interviewed people in Amherst Massachusetts, across a variety of professions\n",
			"to determine how they found out about their jobs. He recorded not only whether\n",
			"they used social contacts in their employment searches, but also the strength of the\n",
			"social relationships as measured by frequency of interaction. He found that a surprising\n",
			"proportion of jobs were obtained through (cid:147)weak ties(cid:148) (as opposed to (cid:147)strong(cid:148) ones).\n",
			"There are various ways to measure the strength of a tie, but Granovetter(cid:146)s basic idea is\n",
			"that strength is related to the (cid:147)amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy\n",
			"(mutual con(cid:133)ding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie,(cid:148)(Granovet-\n",
			"ter [289] p. 1361). His measure of the strength of a tie was by the number of times\n",
			"that individuals had interacted in a past year (strong = at least twice a week, medium\n",
			"= less than twice a week but more than once a year, and weak = once a year or less).\n",
			"Out of the 54 people that Granovetter had detailed interviews with and who had found\n",
			"their most recent job through a social contact, he found that 16.7 percent had found\n",
			"their job through a strong tie, 55.7 percent through a medium tie, and 27.6 percent\n",
			"through a weak tie.28\n",
			"\n",
			"Granovetter(cid:146)s idea was that individuals involved in a weak tie were less likely to\n",
			"have overlap in their neighborhoods than individuals involved in a strong tie. Such\n",
			"ties then are more likely to form bridges across groups that have fewer connections\n",
			"to each other, and can thus play critical roles in the dissemination of information.\n",
			"Granovetter concludes that weak ties are the glue that holds communities together,\n",
			"and in paradoxical contrast, strong ties lead to more local cohesion but then to more\n",
			"overall fragmentation.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are numerous follow-up studies, including direct tests of some of the hypothe-\n",
			"ses put forth by Granovetter (e.g., see Friedkin [240]), as well studies of the roles of\n",
			"weak ties hypotheses in a variety of settings, from the di\u2044usion of technological infor-\n",
			"mation to patterns of immigration. There remain many interesting and basic questions\n",
			"about the relative use of weak ties that are not fully answered or such that the answers\n",
			"vary across applications. For instance, given that individuals tend to have many weak\n",
			"ties (and for employed adults in large societies, conceivably orders of magnitude more\n",
			"weak ties than strong ties), how active should we expect weak ties to be in di\u2044using\n",
			"vital information? Are weak ties important solely because of their bridging behavior\n",
			"and information that they di\u2044use, or more generally because of other features they\n",
			"embody? And even more fundamentally, is it even generally true that individuals in-\n",

			"Regardless of the answers to these and other related questions, Granovetter(cid:146)s work on\n",
			"the strength of weak ties makes it clear that the abstraction to simple 0-1 networks\n",
			"is a crude approximation of interaction structures, and that developing richer models\n",
			"capturing additional nuances of interaction frequency, duration, and heterogeneity, is\n",
			"important.\n",
			"\n",
			"3.2.8 Structural Holes\n",
			"\n",
			"Another important concept regarding the structure of networks is due to Burt [105]\n",
			"and concerns what he named (cid:147)structural holes(cid:148). A structural hole is a void in a social\n",
			"structure, and in terms of social networks refers to an absence of connections between\n",
			"groups. As Burt points out, this does not mean that the groups are unaware of each\n",
			"other, but instead that the lack of links between the groups leads to non-redundancies\n",
			"in the information between the groups and can also lead to a failure of di\u2044usion between\n",
			"the groups. One of Burt(cid:146)s main points is that individuals who (cid:133)ll structural holes, by\n",
			"o\u2044ering connections between otherwise separated or sparsely inter-connected groups,\n",
			"end up with power and control over the (cid:135)ow of information and favors between groups.\n",
			"For instance, Burt [106] o\u2044ers evidence that (cid:133)lling structural holes leads to bene(cid:133)ts\n",
			"in the form of promotion, bonuses, and other measures of performance networks of\n",
			"managers.\n",
			"\n",
			"3.2.9 Social Capital\n",
			"\n",
			"The term social capital has come to embody a number of di\u2044erent concepts related\n",
			"to how social relationships lead to individual or aggregate bene(cid:133)ts in a society. The\n",
			"concept has been de(cid:133)ned in many ways and applied many contexts, so that there is no\n",
			"tight and encompassing de(cid:133)nition of social capital. For instance, in some incarnations\n",
			"it refers to the relationships that an individual has and the potential bene(cid:133)ts that those\n",
			"relationships can bestow (e.g., Bourdieu [?]) and in others it refers to the aspects of\n",
			"broader social interaction (relationships, norms, trust,...) that facilitate cooperation\n",
			"(e.g., see Putnam [?]).29 Although there is resonance in the idea that social networks\n",
			"and social relationships can translate into individual and societal bene(cid:133)ts, and al-\n",
			"though various de(cid:133)nitions of social capital can be useful in identifying the relationship\n",

			"application of social capital, as the term has been so broadly and di\u2044erentially used\n",
			"that it is not always clear what it means. While I will avoid the term social capital\n",
			"in most of what follows, many of the models that appear in this book, especially ones\n",
			"that directly relate social network structure to individual behavior and welfare, can be\n",
			"interpreted as capturing various aspects of social capital, operationally de(cid:133)ned. There\n",

			"\n",
			"3.2.10 Di\u2044usion\n",
			"\n",
			"One important role of social networks is as conduits of information. People often learn\n",
			"from each other, and this has important implications not only for how they (cid:133)nd em-\n",
			"ployment, but also about what movies they see, which products they purchase, how\n",
			"technology becomes adopted, whether or not they participate in government programs,\n",

			"\n",
			"A classic study in this area that illustrates the relation between social structure\n",

			"few (cid:147)innovators(cid:148)and subsequently was adopted by almost all of the doctors by the end\n",
			"of the study. Along with the information about adoption times, Coleman, Katz and\n",

			"doctor(cid:146)s practice, his or her age, general prescription habits, etc.; as well as information\n",
			"about the doctor(cid:146)s social interaction. To get at the social network, Coleman, Katz and\n",
			"Menzel asked each doctor questions which, quoting Coleman, Katz, and Menzel [154],\n",
			"were: (cid:147)To whom did he most often turn for advice and information?(cid:148), (cid:147)With whom\n",

			"is the same as in the BHW model of Chapter 4. In some cases, the payoff\n",
			"depends on a reputation for being informed or for being nonmanipula-\n",
			"tive. An expanded set of messages may not improve the transmission of\n",
			"information (contrary to Chapter 4). If the expert has information on\n",

			"(models of \u201ccheap talk\u201d) and the issues of social learning that are addressed in other\n",
			"parts of this book. For example, herding may arise in \ufb01nancial markets because of the\n",
			"observation of others\u2019 actions or because of the behavior of \ufb01nancial advisors who\n",
			"are in\ufb02uenced by others\u2019 predictions. We will see that herding on actions and herding\n",
			"on words occur under similar conditions.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the generic setting, an agent is an expert with private information on the state of\n",
			"nature, and his action takes the form of a message that is sent to a receiver. How can he\n",
			"transmit his information credibly by mere words? The key is that the receiver has some\n",
			"independent information on the true state \u2013 information that may be gotten before\n",
			"or after the time the expert gives his advice. The receiver thus can verify the expert\u2019s\n",

			"information of the receiver does not matter.) The payoff of the expert depends on his\n",
			"message (his advice) and on the independent information of the receiver.\n",
			"\n",
			"Section 10.1 presents the basic model with two states and a binary private signal\n",
			"of the expert. For simplicity, the receiver veri\ufb01es exactly the true state ex post (as\n",
			"an investor who experiences the \ufb02uctuations of the stock market after receiving an\n",
			"advice). Three types of payoff functions are considered.\n",
			"\n",
			"(i) The least restrictive case is that of an arbitrary function with two arguments: the\n",
			"expert\u2019s message and the state as veri\ufb01ed by the receiver. The goal of the expert\n",
			"is to conform as much as possible to the veri\ufb01ed state. His belief is formed from\n",
			"the public belief and his private signal. If the public belief in one of the two states\n",
			"is high, the probability of that state is high even with a private signal favoring the\n",
			"other state. In that case, the expert predicts the same state as the public belief.\n",
			"The expert tells the truth (sends a prediction according to his private signal)\n",
			"only if the public belief is not too strong on one of the two states. The condition\n",
			"for truthtelling by the expert turns out to be identical to the condition for no\n",
			"herding in the BHW model of Chapter 4.\n",
			"\n",
			"(ii) The payoff is based on reputation. This reputation may be valuable because\n",
			"of future business for the expert, or his ability to have in\ufb02uence in the future.\n",
			"The reputation is about the high precision of the private information. There are\n",
			"two types of private signals for the expert, one more informed than the other;\n",
			"and, in a \ufb01rst case, the expert does not know the quality of his signal. A key\n",
			"difference from (i) is that the value of reputation, and therefore the payoff of\n",
			"the expert, depends on an equilibrium. If the expert sends an irrelevant message\n",
			"(he babbles), then the receiver may ignore his message. If the receiver ignores his\n",

			"Does the waiting game end with a bang or a whimper?\n",

			"Each agent chooses when to invest (if at all) and observes the number\n",

			"on the private information of other agents about the state of nature. The\n",
			"waiting game has in general multiple equilibria. An equilibrium depends\n",
			"on the intertemporal arbitrage between the opportunity cost of delay\n",
			"and the value of the information that is gained from more observations.\n",
			"The informational externality generates strategic substitutabilities and\n",

			"decisions.\n",
			"\n",
			"In 1993, the U.S. economy was in a shaky recovery from the previous recession. The\n",
			"optimism after some good news was dampened by a few pieces of bad news, raised\n",
			"again by other news, and so on. In the trough of the business cycle, each agent\n",
			"is waiting for some good news about an upswing. What kind of news? Some count\n",
			"occupancy rates in the \ufb01rst-class sections of airplanes. Others weigh the newspapers to\n",
			"evaluate the volume of ads. Housing starts and expenditures on durables are standard\n",
			"indicators to watch. The news is the actions of other agents. Everyone could be waiting\n",
			"because everyone is waiting in an \u201ceconomics of wait and see\u201d (Nasar, 1993).\n",
			"\n",
			"In order to focus on the problem of how a recession may be protracted by the game\n",
			"of waiting for more information, we have to take a step back from the intricacies of\n",
			"the real world and the numerous channels of information. In this chapter, agents\n",
			"learn from the observation of the choices of action taken by others, but not from the\n",
			"\n",
			"115\n",
			"\n",
			"\f116\n",
			"\n",
			"Delays\n",
			"\n",
			"payoffs of these actions. This assumption is made to simplify the analysis. It is also\n",
			"justi\ufb01ed in the context of the business cycle, where lags between the initiation of an\n",
			"investment process and its payoff can be long (at least a year or two). The structure of\n",
			"the model is thus the same as in Chapter 3, but each agent can make his investment\n",
			"in any period: he has one option, to make a \ufb01xed-size investment. The central issue is\n",
			"when to exercise the option, if at all.\n",
			"\n",
			"When the value of the investment is strictly positive, delay is costly because the\n",
			"present value of the payoff is reduced by the discount factor. The opportunity cost of\n",
			"delay for one period is the product of the net payoff of investment and the discount\n",
			"rate. Delay enables an agent to observe others\u2019 actions and infer some information\n",
			"on the state of nature. These observations may generate good or bad news. De\ufb01ne\n",
			"the bad news as an event such that the agent regrets ex post an irreversible investment\n",
			"he has made, and would pay a price to undo it (if that were possible). The expected\n",
			"value of this payment in the next period, after observation of the current period\u2019s\n",
			"aggregate investment, is the option value of delay. The key issue that underlines all\n",
			"results in this chapter is the trade-off, in equilibrium, between the opportunity cost\n",
			"and the option value of delay.\n",
			"\n",
			"Consider the model of Chapter 4 with two states of nature, and assume that agents\n",
			"can choose the timing of their investment. If all beliefs (probabilities of the good state)\n",
			"are below the cost of investment, then the only equilibrium is with no investment,\n",
			"and there is a herd as in the BHW model. If all beliefs are higher than the cost of\n",
			"investment, there is an equilibrium in which all agents invest with no delay. This\n",
			"behavior is like a herd with investment in the BHW model, and it is an equilibrium,\n",
			"for nothing is learned by delaying. The herds in the BHW model with exogenous\n",
			"timing are equilibria in the model with endogenous timing.\n",
			"\n",
			"However, the model with endogenous timing may have other equilibria with an\n",
			"arbitrage between the option value and the opportunity cost of delay. For a general\n",
			"distribution of private beliefs, the margin of arbitrage may occur at different points of\n",
			"the distribution. Generically, there are at least two equilibrium points, one in the upper\n",
			"tail of the distribution and another in the lower tail. In the \ufb01rst equilibrium, only the\n",
			"most optimistic agents invest; in the second, only the most pessimistic delay. The two\n",
			"equilibria in which most agents delay or rush, respectively, are not symmetric, because\n",
			"of the arbitrage mechanism. In the \ufb01rst, the information conveyed by the aggregate\n",
			"activity must be large in order to keep the agents at the high margin of beliefs (with\n",
			"a high opportunity cost) from investing. In the second, both the opportunity cost of\n",
			"relatively pessimistic agents and the information conveyed by the aggregate activity\n",
			"are low. In the particular case of a bounded distribution, the rush where few agents\n",
			"delay may be replaced by the corner solution where no agent delays.\n",
			"\n",
			"Multiple equilibria are evidence of strategic complementarities (Cooper and John,\n",
			"1988). These complementarities arise here only because of informational externalities.\n",
			"There is no payoff externality. As in other models with strategic complementarities,\n",

			"multiple equilibria may provide support for sudden switches of regime with large\n",

			"\n",
			"The main ideas of the chapter are presented in Section 6.1 with a simple two-agent\n",
			"model based on Chamley and Gale (1994). The unique equilibrium is computed\n",
			"explicitly.\n",
			"\n",
			"The general model with heterogeneous beliefs is presented in Section 6.2. It is the\n",
			"full extension of the BHW model to endogenous timing. The model of heterogeneous\n",
			"beliefs is a plausible assumption per se, and it generates nonrandom strategies. The\n",
			"model has a number of players independent of the state of nature and generalizes\n",
			"that of Chamley and Gale (1994), who assume identical beliefs. In the model with\n",
			"identical beliefs, the endowment of an option is the private signal, and the number\n",
			"of players thus depends on the state of nature. This case is particularly relevant when\n",
			"the number of players is large.\n",
			"\n",
			"When private beliefs are not identical, the analysis of the symmetric subgame per-\n",
			"fect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) turns out to be simple because of an intuitive property\n",
			"that is related to the arbitrage condition: an agent never invests before another who is\n",
			"more optimistic. Therefore, the agent with the highest belief among those who delay\n",
			"must be the \ufb01rst to invest in the next period if there is any investment in that period\n",
			"(because he has the highest belief then). All equilibria where the arbitrage condition\n",
			"applies can be described as sequences of two-period equilibria.\n",
			"Some properties of the model are presented in Section 6.3. Extensions will be\n",
			"discussed in the next chapter. When the public belief is in a range (\u00b5\u2217\n",
			"), the\n",
			"level of investment in each period is a random variable, and the probability of no\n",
			"investment is strictly positive. If there is no investment, the game stops with a herd,\n",
			"and no investment takes place in any subsequent period. Hence the game lasts a\n",
			"number of periods that is at most equal to the number of players in the game. If the\n",
			"period length tends to zero, the game ends in a vanishingly short time. Because an\n",
			"agent can always delay until the end of the game, and the cost of delay tends to zero\n",
			"with the length of the period, the information generated by the game also tends to\n",
			"zero with the period length: another effect of arbitrage.\n",

			"\n",
			"The game is illustrated in Section 6.3.4 by an example with two agents with\n",

			"multiple equilibria, under some speci\ufb01c conditions. The presence of time lags between\n",

			"The supply of a good and the entry into a new market provide standard examples of\n",

			"Uncertainty about the Size of the Demand\n",
			"In the model of Zeira (1994), suppliers learn about the size of the demand for a good,\n",
			"the capacity of the market. This can be learned only when the number of suppliers\n",
			"exceeds the capacity. As long as the capacity exceeds the supply, we know only that\n",
			"it exceeds the supply. Once the suppliers reach the capacity, the price collapses and\n",
			"suppliers cannot recoup the cost of their investment. Eventually, such a collapse must\n",
			"occur.\n",
			"\n",
			"Uncertainty about the Number of Potential Entrants\n",
			"Section 13.1.2 presents a new model of agents entering a market with uncertainty\n",
			"about the investment costs of other potential entrants. The model is the simplest one,\n",

			"entered the market (by assumption). In the symmetric perfect Bayesian equilibrium,\n",
			"there is delay. The number of periods during which agents delay (on average) increases\n",
			"if the period is shorter, but the mean time of delay is reduced. When time is continuous,\n",
			"there is no equilibrium. Other types of models are presented and related to models\n",
			"where \ufb01rms learn the demand.\n",
			"\n",
			"Uncertainty about the Cost of Production\n",
			"In Caplin and Leahy (1993), the suppliers know the demand for the good, but they\n",
			"are uncertain about the marginal cost of producing it. This cost is the same for all\n",
			"suppliers, for simplicity, and is \ufb01xed at the beginning of time. An agent learns the\n",
			"marginal cost after incurring the \ufb01xed cost of putting the production process in place.\n",
			"The outsiders, who are potential entrants, know that no insider would produce at a\n",
			"marginal cost above the price. They observe the price of the good. As long as entry\n",
			"goes on and the price is falling, outsiders know that the marginal cost is strictly below\n",
			"the price. Because of the positive gap between the price and the expected marginal\n",
			"cost, there is an in\ufb02ow of new suppliers and the price falls gradually. In some cases,\n",
			"the price reaches the marginal cost, and the supply cannot be expanded: that would\n",
			"drive the price below marginal cost. In that event, the supply does not increase, the\n",
			"price stops falling, and outsiders realize that the price has hit the marginal cost. They\n",
			"do not enter the market anymore.2\n",

			"STRATEGIC COMPLEMENTARITY\n",

			"(Chapter 11). Can the inef\ufb01cient equilibrium be ruled out when the game has many\n",
			"periods? Gale (1995) provides, remarkably, a positive answer when the investment is\n",
			"irreversible and the number of agents is not too large (Section 13.2.1). The argument\n",
			"is simple and powerful. Suppose there are two agents and investment yields a positive\n",
			"dividend in each period once both agents have made their irreversible investment.\n",
			"In an equilibrium, agents cannot delay their investment a long time if the period\n",
			"is short. If one agent, A, invests immediately, he is sure that the other, B, if he has\n",
			"not invested also in the \ufb01rst period, will do so in the second: at that stage, B is the\n",

			"\n",
			"2 Actually, some agents who entered before that event realized, after their entry, that the marginal cost\n",

			"both agents coordinated their investment in the \ufb01rst period. The argument can be\n",
			"extended to any \ufb01nite number of agents. The key to the argument is that each agent\n",
			"recognizes his pivotal role: he knows that if he invests, he induces a game with at least\n",
			"one fewer player; the properties of the equilibrium are derived by induction. The main\n",
			"conclusion from the analysis of Gale is that when agents are pivotal (and have some\n",

			"\n",
			"In Section 13.2.2, an opposite property is found when the number of agents is\n",

			"In the \ufb01rst, the supply is perfectly inelastic at some value of \u03b8, which de\ufb01nes the\n",

			"In the second polar form, the supply of the good is perfectly elastic at the price \u03b8\n",
			"and there is a \ufb01xed entry cost per \ufb01rm. The mass of potential entrants is known, but\n",

			"\n",
			"Cooperative game theory starts with a society of players just as a network setting\n",
			"does, but instead of thinking of how the players might be structured in terms of social\n",
			"networks, the foundation is built on simpler structures. In particular, the primitives\n",
			"are how the players might be grouped into subsets or (cid:147)coalitions(cid:148).\n",
			"\n",
			"There are several branches of the theory and an important distinction is made\n",
			"between (cid:147)transferable utility(cid:148) and (cid:147)non-transferable utility (NTU)(cid:148) games. In trans-\n",
			"ferable utility games payo\u2044s can be freely reallocated among players (so that payo\u2044s\n",
			"are transferable), while in non-transferable utility games the payo\u2044s can only come in\n",
			"given con(cid:133)gurations. While both of these branches have natural cousins in the network\n",
			"setting, I focus on the more developed branch of transferable utility.1\n",
			"\n",
			"Cooperative game theory provides a prediction (or prescription, depending on the\n",
			"interpretation) of how the total value generated in a society will (or should) be split\n",
			"among its members. It takes into account the relative values that every possible subset\n",
			"of players could generate, and then based on certain properties of how the allocation of\n",
			"value reacts (or should react) to these values. One interpretation is that the resulting\n",
			"allocation is a prediction of what the outcome will be if the players bargain over how\n",
			"to allocate the total value generated in the society, and when the values of various\n",
			"coalitions of players represent threat points of what they can earn by seceding from\n",
			"the society. As multilateral bargaining is di\u00a2 cult to model non-cooperatively, cooper-\n",
			"ative techniques can be quite useful in this regard. Another interpretation is that the\n",
			"resulting allocation is how a society should allocate its value, based on some principles.\n",
			"\n",
			"1The terminology of (cid:147)cooperative(cid:148) and (cid:147)non-cooperative games is perhaps no longer as useful as\n",
			"it was when (cid:133)rst de(cid:133)ned. The idea of a cooperative game began as an o\u2044shoot of a non-cooperative\n",
			"game. The value that could be generated by a group of players was what they could guarantee\n",
			"themselves by coordinating their strategies in the non-cooperative game. (See Luce and Rai\u2044a [?] for\n",
			"a nice overview of these ideas.) That is, the value of a given coalition of players was derived by looking\n",
			"at the maximum value (in terms of the sum of their payo\u2044s) that they could get across their choices\n",
			"of strategies when the remaining players react by collectively choosing their strategies minimize the\n",
			"coalition(cid:146)s payo\u2044. The idea of a value of a group of agents extends far beyond the original cooperation\n",
			"in a non-cooperative game derivation, and so the terminology is no longer so pertinent. Also, in many\n",
			"applications there is a well-de(cid:133)ned value generated by a group of agents without requiring them to\n",
			"(cid:147)cooperate,(cid:148)especially when the theory is applied normatively. Nevertheless, the terminology remains\n",

			"It helps to keep a few examples in mind.\n",
			"\n",
			"Example 12.1.1 Divide the Dollar.\n",
			"\n",
			"Consider a legislature that operates by majority rule and has a budget to split\n",

			"\n",
			"The divide-the-dollar game is an example of a more general class of games such that\n",
			"there are (cid:147)winning(cid:148) coalitions that can generate a value of 1. The divide the dollar\n",
			"setting is one where those coalitions are ones that contain a majority of the players.\n",
			"More generally, one can consider other possible rules for which coalitions can generate\n",

			"larger coalitions are at least as powerful as smaller coalitions, and is such that there\n",
			"cannot exist disjoint coalitions that each generate a value of 1 at the same time.\n",
			"\n",
			"Example 12.1.3 A Quota Game with Veto Players.\n",
			"\n",
			"Another class of interesting TU games is a subset of the simple games where a\n",
			"speci(cid:133)c player is needed in order to generate value. That is, a coalition is worthless\n",

			"Thus, a coalition generates a value of 1 if and only if it meets the size quota and all\n",

			"\n",
			"12.1.2 Allocating the Value\n",
			"\n",
			"The values of di\u2044erent coalitions form the foundation for the analysis of a cooperative\n",
			"game, as they tell us the value there is to be split among the players and also the extent\n",
			"to which di\u2044erent groups of players are responsible for the generation of the value. The\n",
			"heart of the analysis is then how the value of the society is (or should be) allocated\n",
			"among its members. This is captured by an imputation.\n",
			"\n",
			"An imputation is a function (cid:30) : W (N ) ! IRn such thatPi (cid:30)i(w) = w(N ).\n",
			"\n",
			"An imputation thus indicates how much of the value generated by the full society\n",
			"is allocated to each player. Generally it is presumed that the grand coalition of the full\n",
			"society generates the maximum possible value.3\n",
			"\n",
			"2The actual rules of the U.N. Security Council are a bit more complicated than a simple game as\n",
			"countries are allowed to abstain, and they sometimes do. In addition, di\u2044erent voting rules are used\n",
			"depending on the issue involved, but the basic structure is built on a quota game with veto players.\n",
			"3There is a speci(cid:133)cation that examines more general settings where the value generated depends\n",
			"on how a society is partitioned and such that it might be e\u00a2 cient to have partitions other than the\n",
			"one where all players are grouped together. Such games are called games in partition function form,\n",
			"and can also be seen as special cases of the network setting discussed below.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f12.1. COOPERATIVE GAME THEORY\n",
			"\n",
			"535\n",
			"\n",
			"An imputation can model di\u2044erent things. It might capture the result of a bargain-\n",
			"ing process or it might be a normative analysis of how the value should be allocated.\n",
			"It might also be a measure of the relative power of di\u2044erent members of the society.\n",
			"\n",
			"A prominent imputation rule is the Shapley Value, introduced by Shapley [?]. It\n",
			"has a number of interesting properties, and can be seen as being based on the relative\n",
			"marginal contributions of players towards productive value.\n",
			"\n",

			"\n",
			"n!\n",
			"\n",
			"(cid:19) :\n",
			"\n",
			"A standard interpretation of the Shapley Value is as follows. Uniformly at random,\n",
			"choose an ordering of the players and let it be fi1; i2; : : : ; ing. Now, consider building\n",
			"the society up by adding one player at a time in this order. A player gets the mar-\n",
			"ginal contribution that he or she makes to the society when added to the players who\n",
			"preceded him or her. So, a player i whose place in the order follows a coalition S gets\n",
			"w(S [ fig) (cid:0) w(S). There are #S!(n (cid:0) #S (cid:0) 1)! such orderings, and averaging over\n",
			"all such orderings leads to the Shapley value.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the divide-the-dollar game the Shapley Value allocates 1=n to each player given\n",
			"the full symmetry of the game. This is true of most any imputation. If instead we\n",
			"examine a simple majority game with a single veto player, then we see asymmetries\n",
			"and begin to get an impression of how the Shapley value operates.\n",
			"\n",
			"Example 12.1.4 A Majority Game with One Veto Player.\n",
			"\n",
			"Consider a quota game with an three players and a single veto player, player 1. In\n",

			"\n",
			"The Shapley value of this game can be calculated as follows. There are 6 possible\n",

			"\n",
			"12.1.4 The Core\n",
			"\n",
			"Instead of having an imputation, such as the Shapley Value, which makes a unique\n",

			"on some principles. The most prominent such predictions are based on the (cid:147)core.(cid:148)\n",
			"The idea is that the allocation of the value of the whole society must be such that\n",
			"no coalition could secede and improve each member(cid:146)s payo\u2044 by allocating the value it\n",
			"generates alone to its members.\n",
			"\n",
			"The core of a TU cooperative game is the set of all allocations x 2 IRn such that\n",
			"(cid:15) Pi2N xi = w(N ), and\n",
			"(cid:15) Pi2S xi (cid:21) w(S) for all S (cid:26) N.\n",
			"\n",
			"When the core is nonempty, it makes powerful predictions, as an allocation in the\n",
			"\n",
			"core cannot be blocked by any coalition.\n",
			"\n",
			"The core is sometimes empty as seen, for instance, in the divide-the-dollar game\n",
			"\n",
			"as follows. Consider any allocation x such thatPi2N xi = w(N ). There must exist i\n",
			"such that xi > 0. Thus, it must be thatPj6=i xj < 1, while w(fj : j 6= ig) = 1. Thus,\n",
			"\n",
			"this cannot satisfy the second requirement in the de(cid:133)nition of the core, as the coalition\n",
			"of players other than i are not getting the value that they would obtain by excluding\n",
			"player i. The core of this game is empty.\n",
			"\n",
			"This shows the inherent instability of majority rule, and also previews the di\u2044erence\n",
			"between predictions made based on an imputation rule such as the Shapley Value which\n",
			"in the divide-the-dollar game gives an equal allocation to each player, and the core. To\n",
			"see further di\u2044erences, let us re-examine a game with a veto player.\n",
			"\n",
			"Example 12.1.5 The Core in a Majority Game with One Veto Player.\n",
			"\n",
			"Reconsider the quota game from Example 12.1.4 with three players and a single veto\n",

			"The set of all possible value functions for a society N is denoted V(N ).\n",
			"Note that any pro(cid:133)le of utility functions u = (u1; : : : ; un) generates a value function\n",

			"A value function v is component additive ifPh2C(g) v(h) = v(g).\n",
			"\n",
			"Component additivity is a condition that rules out externalities across components,\n",
			"but still allows externalities within components. That is, the value of a given compo-\n",
			"nent does not depend on how other components are structured. It is quite natural in\n",
			"some contexts, for instance social interactions, but not in situations where di\u2044erent\n",
			"components interact with each other. If the value function is derived as the sum of a\n",
			"component decomposable pro(cid:133)le of utility functions, then it will clearly be component\n",
			"additive.\n",
			"\n",
			"Another prominent subclass of value functions is the set of anonymous ones.\n",

			"of a society ends up being allocated. It is the analog of an imputation, but now in the\n",
			"context of a network setting instead of a cooperative game. In many of the previous\n",
			"chapters, a pro(cid:133)le of utility functions was taken as given. However, bargaining might\n",
			"occur about the terms of trade, or even about favors within a friendship or an allocation\n",
			"of chores. It could also be that there are taxes or subsidies imposed. An allocation\n",
			"rule keeps track of how the total value ends up being allocated after such a process.\n",
			"\n",
			"An allocation rule depends on both g and v. This is important as it can then take\n",
			"account of a player i(cid:146)s role in productive value beyond the speci(cid:133)c network in place. For\n",
			"instance, consider a network g = f12; 23g in a situation where the value generated is 1\n",
			"(v(g) = 1). Player 2(cid:146)s allocation might depend heavily on the values of other networks.\n",
			"For instance, if v(f12; 23; 13g) = 0 = v(f13g), then 2 is essential to the network and\n",
			"may receive a large allocation. If, on the other hand v(g0) = 1 for all networks, then\n",
			"2(cid:146)s role is not particularly special. This information can be relevant, especially in\n",

			"\n",
			"Actions speak louder than words.\n",
			"\n",
			"The basic model of learning from others\u2019 actions is presented. Individual\n",
			"actions are the means of communication between agents. When the set of\n",
			"actions is suf\ufb01ciently large and the actions are observed perfectly, social\n",
			"learning is ef\ufb01cient. When actions are observed through a noise, the\n",
			"public information in history slows down social learning.\n",
			"\n",
			"Why learn from others\u2019 actions? Because these actions re\ufb02ect something about their\n",
			"information. Why don\u2019t we exchange information directly using words? People may\n",
			"not be able to express their information well. They may not speak the same language.\n",
			"They may even try to deceive us. What are we trying to \ufb01nd? A good restaurant, a\n",
			"good movie, a tip on the stock market, whether to delay an investment or not, etc.\n",
			"Other people know something about it, and their knowledge affects their behavior,\n",
			"which, we can trust, will be self-serving. By looking at their behavior, we will infer\n",
			"something about what they know. This chain of arguments will be introduced here\n",
			"and developed in other chapters. We will see how the transmission of information\n",
			"may or may not be ef\ufb01cient and may lead to herd behavior, to sudden changes of\n",
			"widely believed opinions, etc.\n",
			"\n",
			"For actions to speak and to speak well, they must have a suf\ufb01cient vocabulary and\n",
			"be intelligible. In the \ufb01rst model of this chapter, individuals are able to \ufb01ne-tune their\n",
			"action in a suf\ufb01ciently rich set, and their decision process is perfectly known. In such a\n",
			"setting, actions re\ufb02ect perfectly the information of each acting individual. This case is\n",
			"a benchmark in which social learning is equivalent to the direct observation of others\u2019\n",

			"private information perfectly.\n",
			"\n",
			"Actions can reveal private information perfectly only if the individuals\u2019 decision\n",

			"\n",
			"3.1 A Canonical Model of Social Learning\n",
			"\n",
			"The purpose of a canonical model is to present a structure that is suf\ufb01ciently simple\n",
			"and \ufb02exible to be a tool of analysis for a number of issues. Most models in this book\n",
			"are built with the following blocks:\n",
			"\n",
			"\u2022 the structure of information,\n",
			"\u2022 the payoff function and the action set,\n",
			"\u2022 the observability of others.\n",
			"\n",
			"3.1.1 The Model\n",
			"\n",
			"THE INFORMATION ENDOWMENTS\n",
			"We want to analyze how the information of individuals is spread through the observa-\n",
			"tions of their actions. In order to isolate this process, we assume that the information\n",
			"of all agents is given at the beginning of time. This information comes in two parts,\n",
			"as in the previous chapter:\n",
			"1. The state of nature is the value of a parameter \u03b8 belonging to a set \u0001: \u03b8 \u2208 \u0001. By\n",
			"assumption, \u03b8 is the realization of a random variable that takes values in the set\n",
			"\u0001 and cannot be observed directly by anyone. By an abuse of notation, \u03b8 denotes\n",
			"both the random variable and its realization.\n",
			"\n",
			"2. There are N individuals. (In general, N is \ufb01nite, but there could be a countable\n",
			"set of agents or even a continuum.) Each individual i has private information in\n",
			"the form of a private signal si : it is a random variable whose distribution depends\n",
			"on \u03b8; the value of the signal gives some information on the true value of \u03b8. Private\n",
			"signals are by de\ufb01nition not observable by others. Without loss of generality,\n",
			"private signals are independent conditional on the state of nature \u03b8.\n",
			"\n",
			"We saw in the last chapter how different private signals generate a diversity of\n",
			"private beliefs. At this stage, it may be better to model private information by a private\n",
			"signal. Recall that a private belief is an endowment and does not change over time.\n",
			"The belief of an agent in some period t will depend on his observations before that\n",
			"period and will be called simply his belief in period t.\n",
			"\n",
			"ACTIONS AND PAYOFFS\n",
			"\n",
			"Each agent i can take once an action xi in the set \u0001, xi \u2208 \u0001. (Without loss of generality,\n",
			"the set of feasible actions \u0001 is the same for all agents.) If the state is \u03b8 and agent i takes\n",
			"the action xi , he gets the payoff u(xi , \u03b8). For simplicity, the function u is the same for\n",
			"all agents. There could be different functions for different agents, but the important\n",
			"\n",
			"\f44\n",
			"\n",
			"Social Learning with a Common Memory\n",
			"\n",
			"assumption is that this function is known to all agents. Later, this assumption will be\n",
			"relaxed. When an agent makes a decision under imperfect information, he has a sub-\n",
			"jective probability on \u03b8 and his payoff is U = E i [u(xi , \u03b8)], where the expectation E i\n",
			"is measured on \u03b8 given all the information of agent i at the time he takes his action.\n",
			"Because agents \u201cspeak\u201d through their actions, the de\ufb01nition of the action set \u0001\n",
			"is critical. A language with many words may convey more possibilities for communi-\n",
			"cation than a language with few words. Individuals will learn more from each other\n",
			"about a parameter \u03b8 when the actions are in an interval of real numbers than when\n",
			"the actions are restricted to be either zero or one.\n",
			"\n",
			"TOOL 1: BINARY ACTIONS\n",
			"Choosing a restaurant, adopting a standard, etc., imply a zero\u2013one decision. To repre-\n",
			"sent the decision process with discrete actions, we assume that the action set is reduced\n",
			"to two elements: \u0001 = {0, 1}. The state space \u0001 has also two elements, \u0001 = {0, 1}. (The\n",
			"discreteness of \u0001 is less important and is assumed only for simplicity.) The payoff is\n",
			"given by u(x, \u03b8) = \u03b8 \u2212 c, with 0 < c < 1.\n",
			"The investment has a positive payoff in the good state (\u03b8 = 1) and a negative payoff\n",
			"in the bad state (\u03b8 = 0). Under uncertainty, the payoff of investment is E [\u03b8] \u2212 c. In\n",

			"Can exuberance be rational?\n",
			"\n",
			"In this chapter, the actions that reveal private informations about the\n",
			"value of an asset are the agents\u2019 trades. In a model where agents are\n",
			"placed in an exogenous sequence, have different private information,\n",
			"and trade with the market (Glosten and Milgrom, 1985), the trading\n",
			"price provides a suf\ufb01ciently detailed signal to prevent the occurrence of\n",
			"cascades. However, the price may be subject to large and sudden variations\n",
			"and to extended regimes with an incorrect valuation. Transaction costs\n",
			"may keep a large amount of private information hidden. Cascades may\n",
			"occur when agents act strategically in an auction.\n",
			"\n",
			"Learning and herding have fascinated people at least since the tulip mania in the\n",
			"seventeenth century and the experiment of John Law. The standard line is that \ufb01nan-\n",
			"cial markets are wonderful pools in which information is shared ef\ufb01ciently between\n",
			"people. For Keynes, however, they were little more than casinos or \u201cbeauty contests\u201d\n",
			"in which the main goal is not to learn intrinsic values but to guess what people think\n",
			"that other people think (and so on) has the greatest value.\n",
			"\n",
			"Literary descriptions such as Keynes\u2019s have great allure. They arouse emotions,\n",
			"but they only titillate the rational mind. A proper assessment of the mechanism of\n",
			"learning and herding in \ufb01nancial markets requires the modelization of some rational\n",
			"behavior. The modeling task that is required is dif\ufb01cult because it must incorporate\n",
			"suf\ufb01cient complexity to analyze how agents deal with this complexity, and yet at the\n",
			"same time be simple enough for analysis.\n",
			"\n",
			"We have seen that the space of actions of the individuals de\ufb01nes the \u201cvocabulary\u201d\n",
			"used by the agents in their communication, and plays a critical role in the learning\n",
			"mechanisms. In Chapter 3, when an agent takes an action in a continuum, this ac-\n",
			"tion reveals perfectly his private signal (which takes also values in a continuum of\n",
			"dimension one). Herding depends critically on the restricted set of possible actions\n",
			"(Chapter 4).\n",

			"Sequences of Financial Trades\n",
			"\n",
			"In \ufb01nancial markets, the price of an asset is a \ufb01ne instrument and should therefore\n",
			"convey ef\ufb01ciently private information on the intrinsic value of the asset. We have seen\n",
			"in previous chapters how pro\ufb01t-motivated actions convey private information. The\n",
			"payoffs of these actions are granted by nature. In \ufb01nancial markets, however, agents act\n",
			"by trading with others, and the gains of some are often the losses of others. If trading\n",
			"partners are learning rationally, the incentive to communicate through trading may\n",
			"be reduced drastically. An offer to sell conveys the seller\u2019s private information that the\n",
			"asset has a low value. Hence, there is no incentive to buy. A potential seller knows this\n",
			"before proposing to sell and does not bother to trade. This no-trading result (Milgrom\n",
			"and Stokey, 1982) shows that if the meaning of a price is suf\ufb01ciently well de\ufb01ned, it\n",
			"cannot be used to convey information between rational agents.\n",
			"\n",
			"Yet people do trade. That must be because of some other motive, which is not\n",
			"conveyed perfectly by the prices of the assets. Some agents need to sell to meet an\n",
			"emergency, others need to buy to insure against uncertain income in the future, and\n",
			"so on. If these motives were observable by all trading parties, the no-trading result\n",
			"would still apply. It is therefore critical that the non-information-related motives are\n",
			"not perfectly observable to all the trading agents. A convenient method to incorporate\n",
			"idiosyncratic motives for trading is the introduction of noise traders, whose trades are\n",
			"not based on the intrinsic value of the asset. These noise traders will appear in most\n",
			"of the models of \ufb01nancial markets we will consider. Because the observation of noise\n",
			"traders is equivalent to the observation of idiosyncratic motives, their trade will be\n",
			"indistinguishable from that of other informed traders, by assumption.\n",
			"\n",
			"Models with noise traders have been very successful because they imbed some\n",
			"of the complexity of transactions within a tractable framework. They come in two\n",
			"main varieties. The \ufb01rst considers a sequence of transactions between two agents with\n",
			"asymmetric informations; each transaction releases some information. The main\n",
			"model in this line is that of Glosten and Milgrom (1985). The other line of models\n",
			"assumes that agents meet as a group in a market where the equilibrium price conveys\n",
			"a signal about the agents\u2019 informations. Competition in the market may be perfect or\n",
			"imperfect. The solution of the equilibrium is analytically simple when agents have a\n",
			"CARA utility function with constant absolute risk aversion and the random variables\n",
			"have normal distributions. Emblematic models with a CARA\u2013Gauss structure have\n",
			"been presented by Grossman (1976), Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), and Kyle (1985,\n",
			"1989).\n",
			"\n",
			"A sequential model `a la Glosten and Milgrom provides a \ufb01ne microstructure of\n",
			"actions, which is close to that of the BHW model of Chapter 4. It is a natural \ufb01rst step\n",
			"for the analysis of herding in \ufb01nancial markets. The CARA\u2013Gauss model will be the\n",
			"subject of the next chapter.\n",
			"\n",
			"The model of Glosten and Milgrom generates an endogenous bid\u2013ask spread that\n",
			"is not due to transaction costs. We will see that in this model the convergence is as fast as\n",
			"if private signals were observable. This model will be the basis for a model of herding\n",
			"by Avery and Zemsky (1998) presented in Section 14.2. The results of Avery and\n",
			"\n",
			"\f14.1 Learning in the Model of Glosten and Milgrom\n",
			"\n",
			"319\n",
			"\n",
			"Zemsky are essentially negative. We have seen in Chapter 4 that herds may occur\n",
			"when the action space is limited (for example, discrete). In a \ufb01nancial market with\n",
			"one asset of uncertain value, the price is a pretty \ufb01ne signal, which prevents mimetic\n",
			"chains from taking place. We will also examine an argument of Avery and Zemsky for\n",
			"temporary herds and sudden price changes.\n",
			"\n",
			"Auctions are one form of \ufb01nancial markets. The possibility of herding with auc-\n",
			"tions has been analyzed by Neeman and Orosell (1999) in a model that is presented\n",
			"in Section 14.4.\n",
			"\n",
			"14.1 Learning in the Model of Glosten and Milgrom\n",
			"\n",
			"A \ufb01nancial asset is a claim on a random variable to be realized after the actions have\n",
			"taken place (as in all models in this book, where learning operates through actions).\n",
			"This asset is traded as follows. The market is represented by a broker who runs a\n",
			"trading desk and is perfectly competitive with other brokers (the sole purpose of the\n",
			"background brokers is to enforce perfect competition, which simpli\ufb01es the model).\n",
			"The broker, called the marketmaker, is risk-neutral and maximizes his expected pro\ufb01t\n",
			"in each transaction. In each period, he is visited by one agent. The agent is either\n",
			"an informed trader who has private information on the fundamental value of the\n",
			"asset, or a noise trader who is determined to buy or to sell with equal probabilities\n",
			"(to simplify). The agent who comes to the market proposes to buy or sell exactly\n",
			"one unit of the asset. (There is no choice of the quantity of the asset.) The best the\n",
			"marketmaker can do is to post two prices, a bid price to buy and an ask price to sell.\n",
			"(The marketmaker can sell short.) Suppose that the visitor is willing to sell at the bid\n",
			"price. The marketmaker is taking a chance: he could take a loss if the visitor is an\n",
			"informed agent who is willing to sell because he knows that the asset is not worth\n",
			"its price; but he could also make a gain if the visitor has to sell for personal reasons,\n",
			"no matter what the value of the asset. Because the marketmaker may face a loss with\n",
			"the informed agent, his bid price, i.e., his price contingent on facing an agent who\n",
			"is willing to sell, is below the expected value of the asset in the common knowledge,\n",
			"i.e., before he meets a visitor who could be of either of the possible types. Likewise,\n",
			"the ask price will be above the expected value before he meets a potential partner for\n",
			"trading. I present here a special case of Glosten and Milgrom\u2019s (1985) model, which\n",

			"when he sells to informed agents with a relatively good signal. Hence his sale price p A\n",
			"must be above the public belief to generate a pro\ufb01t on the noise traders. However, this\n",
			"margin (which depends on the public belief) raises the minimum value of the signal\n",
			"for informed agents who buy at some value s . Because the probability that s > s is\n",
			"higher when \u03b8 = 1 than \u03b8 = 0, the sale carries a powerful message on the state.\n",

			"As long as the equilibrium does not break down, there cannot be a cascade. In a\n",
			"cascade, there would be no learning from buying or selling. (Recall that some buying\n",
			"and selling take place because of the noise traders.) Both prices p A and pB would be\n",
			"identical to \u00b5 by the zero-pro\ufb01t condition. In this case, however, some informed agents\n",
			"would buy whereas some others would sell (because private signals do convey some\n",
			"information), and the equilibrium would convey some information. The nonexistence\n",
			"of a cascade is very much related to the \ufb01ne structure of the market price. The bid\u2013ask\n",
			"spread is endogenous in the model. When learning takes place, the bid\u2013ask spread\n",
			"shrinks to zero asymptotically (Proposition 4 in Glosten and Milgrom, 1985), but it\n",
			"is suf\ufb01cient to discriminate between some informed agents, and trade conveys some\n",
			"\n",
			"\f322\n",
			"\n",
			"Sequences of Financial Trades\n",
			"\n",
			"information. The situation would be very different, of course, if the bid\u2013ask spread\n",

			"\n",
			"14.2 Herds\n",
			"\n",
			"We know from Chapters 2 and 3 that the properties of a model with social learning\n",
			"depend critically on the structure of private information and actions. The previous\n",
			"section showed that with binary signals, the model cannot generate cascades and\n",
			"beliefs do converge to the truth. The prices, which can take values in a continuum,\n",
			"prevent the occurrence of a cascade: if all informed agents ignored their private signals,\n",
			"the price would not reveal information and it would have to be identical to the public\n",
			"belief, by arbitrage. In that case, however, informed agents would take into account\n",

			"Strategic Network Formation\n",
			"\n",
			"While the random network models discussed in Chapters ?? and ?? are useful in grow-\n",
			"ing large and complex networks that exhibit certain features, they are still lacking\n",
			"along some important dimensions. In particular, there are many settings where not\n",
			"only chance but also choice plays a central role in determining relationships. Social\n",
			"settings by de(cid:133)nition involve sentient actors who have discretion in which relationships\n",
			"they form and maintain, and generally have discretion in how much e\u2044ort, time, or\n",
			"resources that they devote to di\u2044erent relationships. Examples of this include trading\n",
			"relationships, political alliances, employer-employee relationships, marriages, profes-\n",
			"sional collaborations, citations, emails, friendships, and so forth.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are two central aspects to modeling networks from a (cid:147)strategic(cid:148) point of\n",
			"view. The (cid:133)rst is that we must explicitly model the costs and bene(cid:133)ts that arise\n",
			"from various networks. Doing this not only enables us to model how networks form in\n",
			"the face of individual incentives to form or sever links, but also provides well-de(cid:133)ned\n",
			"measures of overall societal welfare. Thus, we not only have predictions about which\n",
			"networks might form, but we also have measures of which networks are (cid:147)best(cid:148) from\n",
			"society(cid:146)s point of view. The second aspect of modeling strategic network formation is\n",
			"making a prediction of how individual incentives translate into network outcomes. In\n",
			"this chapter I focus on an equilibrium method, and come back to discuss a variety of\n",
			"possible methods as well as dynamic models in Chapter ??.\n",
			"\n",
			"From the outset, it is important to emphasize what is or is not embodied in a\n",
			"(cid:147)strategic(cid:148)model. Individuals need not be Machiavellian and calculate their potential\n",
			"bene(cid:133)ts and costs from each potential relationship. What is critical is that they have a\n",
			"tendency to form relationships that are (mutually) bene(cid:133)cial and to drop relationships\n",
			"that are not. The forces behind such incentives can be quite strong and can operate\n",

			"\n",
			"with people even being aware that they are in(cid:135)uenced in this way. The term strategic\n",
			"thus carries with it connotations that are not necessary to its application.\n",
			"\n",
			"Some of the important conclusions from the literature on strategic network for-\n",
			"mation regard the comparison between the networks that form based on individual\n",
			"incentives and those networks that maximize overall societal welfare. There is often\n",
			"some disparity and generally a tension between the individual incentives and societal\n",
			"welfare. This is not surprising given that there are externalities present. For example,\n",
			"one of my trading partners in a market might care whom I choose as my other trading\n",
			"partners as that could a\u2044ect the prices or other terms of trade that he or she ends up\n",
			"with, even though he or she may have little direct in(cid:135)uence over my choice of whom\n",
			"else I trade with. The interesting aspect of this tension is how extensive and resilient it\n",
			"is. In particular, as we shall see, even if there are transfers present so that individuals\n",
			"can be subsidized to maintain relationships that would be in society(cid:146)s interest but are\n",
			"not in their own interests, it can still be impossible to maintain the socially e\u00a2 cient\n",
			"networks, under some reasonable restrictions on transfers.\n",
			"\n",
			"Another important aspect of strategic models of network formation is that they\n",
			"provide answers as to why networks take particular forms, rather than just how they\n",
			"take particular forms. For example, growing random network models allowed us to\n",
			"trace certain aspects of networks, such as the shape of the degree distribution and\n",
			"clustering, to speci(cid:133)c types of network formation, such as the extent to which nodes\n",
			"are formed uniformly at random versus via preferential attachment and whether new\n",
			"nodes are met by navigating the network or searching at random. While such analyses\n",
			"relate features of the network to features of the formation process, they do not provide\n",
			"an understanding of why people would tend towards preferential attachment in some\n",
			"settings and not others. The strategic approach ties explanations back to fundamental\n",
			"aspects of the setting. For example, as discussed below, the explanation behind the\n",
			"combination of high clustering and low diameter comes out of a strategic analysis which\n",
			"relates high clustering to low costs of connecting to nodes that are close in social or\n",
			"geographical distance, and low diameter to the bene(cid:133)ts of accessing the information\n",
			"held by distant nodes. This brings us to a related point. In a situation where there is\n",
			"di\u2044usion of information through a network, agents payo\u2044s will depend on the access to\n",
			"information that they have. As a result, this will shape their incentives regarding which\n",
			"relationships to form or maintain, and ultimately will a\u2044ect the network structure.\n",

			"\n",
			"203\n",
			"\n",
			"In order to model network formation in a way that accounts for individual incentives,\n",
			"we (cid:133)rst need to model the net payo\u2044s or utility that each agent receives as a function\n",
			"of the network.\n",
			"\n",
			"In this setting, the nodes of the network N = f1; : : : ; ng will often be referred to\n",
			"\n",
			"as (cid:147)players.(cid:148)\n",
			"\n",
			"The overall bene(cid:133)t net of costs that a player enjoys from a network is modeled via\n",
			"a utility function or payo\u2044 function. That is, the payo\u2044 to a player i is represented\n",
			"by a function ui : G(N ) ! IR, where ui(g) represents the net bene(cid:133)t that i receives if\n",
			"network g is in place.1\n",
			"\n",
			"The utility function captures all of the bene(cid:133)ts net of costs that a given player\n",
			"experiences as a function of the network in place. Depending on the setting these can\n",
			"include very di\u2044erent things, such as the value of trading opportunities if this is a\n",
			"trading network or the value of information that might be obtained if this is a job-\n",
			"contact network. The extent to which the players in a network would (cid:147)know(cid:148) their\n",
			"own or other people(cid:146)s utility functions is very much context-dependent. What is most\n",
			"critical for the approach described here is that they be aware of changes in their own\n",
			"utility as they add or delete links, or at least react in terms of adding relationships\n",
			"that increase payo\u2044s and delete relationships that decrease payo\u2044s.\n",
			"\n",
			"In order to capture the fact that forming a relationship or link between two play-\n",
			"ers usually involves mutual consent, while severing a relationship only involves the\n",
			"consent of one player, we need an equilibrium or stability concept that di\u2044ers from\n",
			"an o\u2044-the-shelf adaptation of a non-cooperative game theoretic solution such as Nash\n",
			"equilibrium (see Section 9.10 for a primer on game theory). Nash equilibrium-based\n",
			"solution concepts fail to capture the possibility that if two players each want to engage\n",
			"in a relationship then we should expect them to.\n",
			"\n",
			"To get a feeling for this issue, let us consider a basic example (see Chapter 11 for\n",
			"a more detailed discussion). Consider just two individuals and a choice of whether or\n",
			"not to form a link. A natural inclination is to model this as a game where players\n",
			"(simultaneously) announce whether or not they wish to be linked to each other. If\n",
			"they both announce that they wish to form the link, then it is formed, while if either\n",
			"says that they do not wish to form the link does then the link is not formed. Thus,\n",
			"\n",
			"1This can be viewed as a special case of a richer object called an allocation rule, as de(cid:133)ned in\n",
			"\n",
			"Jackson and Wolinsky [343], which is described in more detail in Chapter ??.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f204\n",
			"\n",
			"CHAPTER 6. STRATEGIC NETWORK FORMATION\n",
			"\n",
			"it takes mutual consent to form a relationship. Suppose the link is bene(cid:133)cial to both\n",
			"players. One might try to use the concept of Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is\n",
			"a choice of action by each player, such that no player would bene(cid:133)t by changing his or\n",
			"her action, given the actions of the other player(s). Unfortunately, that is not a very\n",
			"useful concept here. There are two equilibria: one where both players say they wish to\n",
			"form the link and it is formed, and another where both players say they do not wish to\n",
			"form the link and it is not formed. The second pair of actions form a Nash equilibrium\n",
			"since neither player has an incentive to change his or her action, given the (correct)\n",
			"anticipation that the other player will say that he or she does not want to form the\n",
			"link. This second equilibrium does not make much sense in a social setting, where we\n",
			"would expect the players to talk to each other and form the link if it is in their mutual\n",
			"interest. However, standard game theoretic concepts do not take this into account.2\n",
			"This is an indication of the fact that some standard game theoretic equilibrium notions\n",
			"are not well-suited for the study of network formation, as they do not properly account\n",
			"for the communication and coordination that is important in the formation of social\n",
			"relationships in networks.\n",
			"\n",
			"A die-hard game theorist might respond that this is simply because the game has\n",
			"not been properly de(cid:133)ned. We could explicitly model all of the communication that\n",
			"is available between the individuals, and then the actions that they might take in\n",
			"response, etc. While on the face of it this might seem reasonable, it is impractical\n",
			"for at least two reasons. One is that modeling the possible communication is very\n",
			"cumbersome. A game that incorporates all of the back and forth that might go on\n",
			"in forming a social relationship is complex, and yet all of the added complexity only\n",
			"captures a very simple idea: that two individuals should be able to coordinate on\n",
			"forming a link when it is in their mutual interest. Moreover, even once such a game is\n",
			"modeled, it might have multiple equilibria and need special re(cid:133)nements on beliefs and\n",
			"other aspects of equilibrium in order to make fairly obvious predictions. An alternative\n",
			"to all of this modeling is to directly de(cid:133)ne an equilibrium notion on networks that\n",
			"incorporates mutual consent.\n",
			"\n",
			"A very simple stability concept that captures mutual consent is pairwise stability,\n",
			"\n",
			"as de(cid:133)ned by Jackson and Wolinsky [343],3 which we previewed in Section ??.\n",
			"\n",
			"2There are some re(cid:133)nements of Nash equilibrium (such as undominated Nash or trembling hand\n",
			"perfect equilibrium) that select the (cid:147)natural(cid:148)equilibrium of forming the link in this particular example,\n",
			"but fail to handle other examples. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.\n",
			"\n",
			"3This should not be confused with a similarly named concept that has been used in the (cid:147)marriage\n",
			"market(cid:148)literature following Gale and Shapley [?]. Although related, there are distinctions as the Gale\n",

			"A network g is pairwise stable if\n",
			"\n",
			"(i) for all ij 2 g, ui(g) (cid:21) ui(g (cid:0) ij) and uj(g) (cid:21) uj(g (cid:0) ij), and\n",
			"(ii) for all ij =2 g, if ui(g + ij) > ui(g) then uj(g + ij) < uj(g).\n",
			"A network is pairwise stable if no player wants to sever a link and no two players\n",
			"both want to add a link. This comes in two parts in the de(cid:133)nition. The requirement\n",
			"that no player wishes to delete a link that he or she is involved in implies that a player\n",
			"has the discretion to unilaterally terminate relationships that he or she is involved in.\n",
			"The second part of the de(cid:133)nition can be stated in various ways. In order for a network\n",
			"to be pairwise stable, it is required that if some link is not in the network and one of\n",
			"the involved players would bene(cid:133)t from adding it, then the other player would su\u2044er\n",
			"from the addition of the link. Another way to state this is that if a network g is such\n",
			"that the creation of some link would bene(cid:133)t both players involved (with at least one\n",
			"of them strictly bene(cid:133)ting), then g is not stable.\n",
			"\n",
			"While pairwise stability is natural and easy to work with, there are limitations\n",
			"to the concept that deserve discussion (and are discussed at more length in Chapter\n",
			"11). First, pairwise stability is a weak notion in that it only considers deviations on a\n",
			"single link at a time. Although this makes it easy to apply, if other sorts of deviations\n",
			"are viable and attractive, then pairwise stability could be too weak a concept. For\n",
			"instance, it could be that a player would not bene(cid:133)t from severing any single link but\n",
			"would bene(cid:133)t from severing several links simultaneously, and yet the network could\n",
			"still be pairwise stable. Second, pairwise stability considers only deviations by at\n",
			"most a pair of players at a time. It might be that some group of players could all be\n",
			"made better o\u2044 by some more complicated reorganization of their links, which is not\n",
			"accounted for under pairwise stability. To the extent that larger groups can coordinate\n",
			"their actions in making changes in a network, a stronger solution concept might be\n",
			"needed. While this might sound arti(cid:133)cial, such group actions can capture things like\n",
			"the expulsion or ostracism of an individual. In both of these regards, pairwise stability\n",
			"might be thought of as a necessary but not su\u00a2 cient requirement for a network to be\n",
			"stable over time. Nevertheless, pairwise stability still turns out to be quite useful and\n",
			"often provides tight predictions about the set of stable networks without the need to\n",
			"consider richer deviations.\n",
			"\n",
			"and Shapley notion allows a pair of individuals to simultaneously divorce their previous partners and\n",
			"marry each other. The pairwise stability notion de(cid:133)ned on networks only considers one link at a time.\n",

			"this link and so D2 (cid:20) c and so D (cid:20) pc as claimed.\n",
			"Next, let us argue that the number of links in a pairwise stable network is at most\n",
			"n(cid:0) 1 + 3n2\n",
			"pc . First, there are at most n(cid:0) 1 edges which are bridges (so that the network\n",
			"would have more than one component if the link were removed).7 So, we need to argue\n",
			"that there are at most 3n2\n",
			"pc links that are not bridges. Consider a link ij that is not a\n",
			"bridge. Let Aij be the set of nodes (including j) for which the shortest path to i goes\n",
			"through j. If ij is deleted, the distance between i and a node in Aij can become at most\n",
			"double the diameter of the network (denoted by d). Thus, deleting the link increases\n",
			"the distance costs by at most 2djAijj and so this must be at least c as otherwise i\n",
			"should sever the link, Thus jAijj (cid:21) c\n",
			"2d. This implies that any given node i can have\n",
			"at most 2dn=c non-bridge links, so there are at most dn2=c non-bridge links in total.\n",
			"Since d (cid:20) 3pc, it follows that there are at most 3n2=pc non-bridge links.\n",
			"Finally, to derive the price of anarchy, we simply need to bound the cost of pairwise\n",
			"stable networks. A crude upper bound on the cost is n(n (cid:0) 1) times the diameter plus\n",
			"two times c times the number of links. We also know that the cost of the e\u00a2 cient\n",

			"\n",
			"Next, let us derive a lower bound for an individual(cid:146)s clustering (and thus average\n",

			"\n",
			"One question is to what extent this problem can be dealt with via some transfers\n",

			"\n",
			"227\n",

			"or favors for maintaining her links with the other players.\n",
			"In fact, intuition from\n",
			"the sociology literature would suggest that a player in such a central position should\n",
			"receive a high payo\u2044 (e.g., see Burt [105]), which could come from the implicit power\n",

			"that come along with the indirect connections that the player provides. If we start to\n",
			"account for such reallocations, can e\u00a2 ciency and stability be reconciled? And, more\n",
			"generally, what characterizes the settings where there is a tension and when can some\n",
			"sort of transfers help?\n",
			"\n",
			"Let us start with the basic question of whether or not it is possible to make some\n",
			"transfer payments among the players so that at least some e\u00a2 cient network ends up\n",
			"being stable. It turns out, as Jackson and Wolinsky [343] showed, that there are some\n",
			"very simple and natural settings where it is not possible to make transfers to align\n",
			"incentives and e\u00a2 ciency, without violating some basic principles about how transfers\n",
			"should or would be structured. To make this precise, we need a few de(cid:133)nitions.\n",
			"\n",
			"A transfer rule is a function t : G ! IRN such thatPi ti(g) = 0 for all g.\n",
			"\n",
			"A transfer rule can thus capture any reallocation of payo\u2044 at a given network.\n",
			"These payments could subsidize or tax certain links or collections of links, and could\n",
			"be due to intervention by some outside authority or due to bargaining by the players.\n",
			"What matters to players is the net payo\u2044 they receive as a function of the network.\n",
			"The requirement that transfers sum to 0 is usually termed a (cid:147)balance(cid:148)condition, and\n",
			"embodies the idea that the system neither depends on any outside infusion of capital\n",
			"in order to operate, nor does it destroy value.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the presence of transfers, player i(cid:146)s net payo\u2044 becomes ui(g) + ti(g), and this\n",
			"is used by the player in decisions regarding the addition or deletion of links. That is,\n",
			"pairwise stability is then applied where the payo\u2044s to the players from a network g are\n",
			"ui(g) + ti(g) rather than ui(g).\n",
			"\n",
			"A (cid:133)rst thing to note is that there is a transfer rule that aligns individual and societal\n",

			"individual(cid:146)s net payo\u2044, as each individual equally shares in the overall societal value.\n",
			"While this is one way to realign individual incentives, there are reasons that such rules\n",
			"would not tend to arise. These are captured in the following conditions.\n",
			"\n",
			"6.6.2 Component Balance\n",
			"\n",
			"One condition that we would expect transfers to satisfy when they arise from a bargain-\n",
			"ing or voluntary process, and also in situations where a society worries about secession,\n",
			"is the following.\n",
			"\n",
			"A transfer rule t is component balanced if there are no net transfers across com-\n",
			"\n",
			"ponents of the network; that is,Pi2S ti(g) = 0 for each network g and component of\n",
			"players S 2 (cid:5)(N; g).\n",
			"\n",
			"Component balance requires that the value of a given component of a network is\n",
			"allocated to the members of that component. This is a condition that a planner or\n",
			"government would like to respect if they wish to avoid secession by components of the\n",
			"network, or if they wish to only reallocate value among the individuals who generated\n",
			"it.\n",
			"\n",
			"Whether or not component balance of the transfers is a compelling condition de-\n",
			"pends on the context, and in particular on the utility functions. If the utility functions\n",
			"exhibit externalities across components, so that the payo\u2044s in one component depend\n",
			"on how other components are organized, then it may be important to make transfers\n",
			"across components. This is the case, for instance, when links are cooperative ventures\n",
			"between (cid:133)rms and (cid:133)rms are in competition with each other. For example, if links refer\n",
			"to code-sharing between airlines, then a given group of airlines might care to what ex-\n",
			"tent airlines whom they are not linked to are linked to each other. Applications where\n",
			"component balance makes more sense are those where, for instance, links represent\n",
			"friendships and it does not matter to a given player how players in completely sepa-\n",
			"rate components are organized. Component balance is also a condition that one might\n",
			"expect to arise naturally if the transfers are coming out of some bargaining process.\n",
			"For example, individuals in one component might not be willing to make transfers to\n",
			"another component of individuals provided the second component(cid:146)s organization has\n",
			"no e\u2044ect on the (cid:133)rst component.\n",
			"\n",
			"It is important to emphasize that the result below only requires that component\n",
			"balance be applied in situations where there are absolutely no externalities across\n",
			"\n",
			"\f6.6. A GENERAL TENSION BETWEEN STABILITY AND EFFICIENCY\n",
			"\n",
			"229\n",

			"all i and g.15\n",
			"\n",
			"6.6.3 Equal Treatment of Equals\n",
			"\n",
			"Another basic condition regarding transfers is an equal treatment condition. The\n",
			"condition of equal treatment has a rich tradition in social choice (e.g., see Thomson\n",
			"[?]). It requires that two players who are completely identical according to all criteria\n",
			"should end up with the same transfers or allocations. It is one of the most basic fairness\n",
			"criteria.\n",
			"\n",
			"In the context of social networks, the condition can be formulated as follows. Given\n",
			"two players i and j and a network g, let gij denote the network derived from switching\n",
			"the positions of i and j (and switching each of their connections).16\n",
			"\n",
			"Two players i and j are complete equals relative to a pro(cid:133)le of utility functions u\n",

			"and a network g if the following holds.\n",
			"\n",

			"(cid:15) ui(bg) = uj(bgij) and uj(bg) = ui(bgij) for allbg 2 G(N ).\n",

			"For more on that formulation, see Chapter 12.\n",

			"with transfers are 4:25+t1, 4:5+t2 and 4:25+t3, where t1; t2; t3 are the transfers on this\n",

			"the middle two-link network to be pairwise stable, it must be that the (cid:133)rst and third\n",
			"players would not gain from adding the missing link. So t1 = t3 (cid:21) (cid:0):25. However, in\n",
			"order to have the network be pairwise stable we also need the second player, or center\n",
			"player, to be willing to keep both of the links that are in place. As that player gets a\n",
			"payo\u2044 of 6 if either link is deleted, it must be that t2 (cid:21) 1:5. However, now the sum of\n",
			"the transfers exceeds 0 and hence component balance is violated (in fact, even a basic\n",

			"\n",

			"While this is only an example, it has natural properties in that some intermediate\n",

			"If we drop equal treatment of equals,\n",
			"but keep component balance, then a careful and clever construction of transfers by\n",
			"Dutta and Mutuswami [200] ensures that some e\u00a2 cient network is strongly stable for\n",

			"pairwise stable. Moreover, while transfers will sometimes fail to satisfy equal treatment\n",
			"of equals, they can be structured so as treat completely equal players equally on at least\n",
			"one network that is both e\u00a2 cient and pairwise stable.18\n",

			"\n",
			"233\n",
			"\n",
			"While the details of the proof of Proposition 6.6.2 are involved, we can see some\n",
			"of the intuition by seeing how it would work in Example ??. Here, we set transfers so\n",
			"that if player 2 is involved in a single link network, then he or she pays the other player\n",
			"at least 1.5. Under such transfers, the two link network with player 2 in the middle\n",
			"is pairwise stable, as he or she no longer gets a higher utility from severing one of the\n",
			"links.\n",
			"\n",
			"Next, note that if we weaken e\u00a2 ciency to Pareto e\u00a2 ciency, Proposition 6.6.1 no\n",
			"longer holds. This takes a bit of proof to show generally, as one needs to work with\n",
			"speci(cid:133)c transfers and then to (cid:133)nd an algorithm to identify pairwise stable networks\n",
			"that are Pareto e\u00a2 cient. That method is described in Exercise 6.14.\n",
			"It is easy to\n",
			"see why this is true in the network in Figure ?? above, as without any transfers the\n",
			"single link networks are pairwise stable and Pareto e\u00a2 cient. Although this is of some\n",
			"interest, when admitting transfers Pareto e\u00a2 ciency is arguably not the right notion of\n",
			"e\u00a2 ciency. Instead, an e\u00a2 ciency notion that considers the admitted transfers is more\n",
			"appropriate, and then the result of Proposition 6.6.1 extends as there is an incompati-\n",
			"bility of stability and e\u00a2 ciency allowing for component-balanced transfers that satisfy\n",
			"equal treatment of equals (as outlined in Exercise 6.8).\n",
			"\n",
			"So, reconciling the tension between stability and e\u00a2 ciency requires giving something\n",

			"\n",
			"also found across other professions. For instance, Rees and Shultz [531] interviewed\n",
			"workers in a Chicago neighborhood and kept track of what percentage of them found\n",
			"out about their current jobs through friends or relatives. They considered twelve\n",
			"di\u2044erent occupations and found rates of jobs obtained through social contacts ranging\n",
			"from a low of 23.5 percent (for accountants) to a high of 73.8 percent (for material\n",
			"handlers). The array of occupations they considered was broad, including typists (37.3\n",
			"percent from social contact), janitors (65.5 percent), electricians (57.4 percent), and\n",
			"truck drivers (56.8 percent), to take a few examples. While these are mostly manual\n",
			"labor jobs, similar patterns are exhibited across di\u2044erent types of work. Granovetter(cid:146)s\n",
			"[289], [290] interviews of residents of Amherst Massachusetts found similar patterns\n",
			"across various types of occupations. He found that 44 percent of technical workers\n",
			"found their jobs through a social contact, as did 56 percent of professional workers,\n",

			"These numbers provide an impression of the extent to which social networks play\n",

			"hundred thousand dollars and one billion dollars. The (cid:133)rms are basically divided into\n",
			"two groups: manufacturers and contractors. For instance, a contractor might have a\n",
			"design for a particular garment and want a given number of them produced and deliv-\n",
			"ered. A manufacturer would then take the garment design and produce and deliver the\n",
			"garments. The (cid:133)rms were selected via a strati(cid:133)ed random sample. Uzzi(cid:146)s focus was on\n",
			"the type of relationships that (cid:133)rms had with each other. One type of relationship he\n",
			"categorized as (cid:147)market(cid:148)or (cid:147)arm(cid:146)s length(cid:148)relationships which included many one-time\n",
			"transactions, and the other he categorized as (cid:147)special(cid:148) or (cid:147)close(cid:148) relationships which\n",
			"included many relationships with repeated interaction and ones that involved idiosyn-\n",
			"cracies in products or special investments. Based on the interviews, Uzzi identi(cid:133)ed\n",
			"three main ingredients that are associated with close ties but not with arm(cid:146)s length\n",
			"ties: trust, (cid:133)ne-grained information transfer, and joint problem solving. This view is\n",
			"derived from interpretations of the interviews and associated anecdotes. Uzzi quotes\n",
			"an example where trust is associated with dealing with an unforeseen problem, such\n",
			"as a fabric not producing the sort of garments that a contractor desires, and then\n",
			"reaching some agreement on how to deal with this problem rather than leaving the\n",
			"manufacturer at a loss. The (cid:133)ne-grained information transfer refers to passing along\n",
			"useful information, for instance about a new design, fabric, or technique, to someone\n",
			"with whom one is in a repeated relationship. Firms involved in close relationships have\n",
			"more of an incentive to pass along such information, and can also do so in a credible\n",
			"manner. The joint problem solving refers to being able to quickly deal with problems\n",
			"that arise, which often hinges on knowing what the capabilities and situations of both\n",
			"(cid:133)rms in a relationship are.\n",
			"\n",
			"Using these insights of how close relationships might help (cid:133)rms, Uzzi builds a hy-\n",
			"pothesis that (cid:133)rms that have more embedded relationships will have a higher probabil-\n",
			"ity of survival. To test this hypothesis, he examines 1991 data from the International\n",
			"Ladies Garment Workers(cid:146) Union, which keeps detailed records of inter-(cid:133)rm transac-\n",
			"tions in the industry. Over 80 percent of the (cid:133)rms are unionized, and these data cover\n",
			"most of the active (cid:133)rms in New York that year. Based on these data, Uzzi examines\n",
			"the contractors who failed versus those who did not. Out of the 479 contractors with\n",
			"complete records in the data set, 125 failed during this year.3 Uzzi measures how\n",
			"ij where Pij is the percentage of all of\n",

			"\n",

			"one manufacturer then this will be 1, whereas if the contractor spreads its business out\n",
			"among many manufacturers then this will tend towards 0. 15 percent of the contractors\n",
			"send 100 percent of their business to one manufacturer, and 45 percent send at least\n",
			"50 percent of their business to one manufacturer, while almost 20 percent send less\n",
			"than 25 percent to any one manufacturer. Thus, there is some variation in the data,\n",
			"but also substantial embeddedness according to this measure. Uzzi then regresses the\n",
			"survival variable on this embeddedness measure, as well as a series of other background\n",
			"variables (geographic location, age of the (cid:133)rm, size of the (cid:133)rm, some network central-\n",
			"ity measures, and other neighborhood variables). He (cid:133)nds a positive and signi(cid:133)cant\n",
			"relationship (at the 95 percent con(cid:133)dence level) between survival and embeddedness.\n",
			"Based on the (cid:133)tted regression line, a typical (cid:133)rm (setting other controls to average\n",
			"levels) that has an embeddedness score of 0 will fail to exist at the end of the year with\n",
			"a probability of .27, while a (cid:133)rm with an embeddedness score of 1 will fail to exist at\n",
			"the end of the year with a probability of .14.\n",
			"\n",
			"As with any cross-sectional statistical analysis, it is di\u00a2 cult to draw causal con-\n",
			"clusions from an observed correlation. It could be that embeddedness helps (cid:133)rms to\n",
			"survive, or it could be that (cid:133)rms that are near failure have a harder time establishing\n",
			"close relationships. Uzzi argues that it is the former. There could also be many other\n",
			"factors that are not observed and that contribute to the type of arrangements that\n",
			"(cid:133)rms have. For example, it might be that more complicated garments require special-\n",
			"ized relationships and also are in a less competitive part of the business. Regardless\n",
			"of what the precise explanation for the observed correlations, or which direction the\n",
			"causation goes, Uzzi(cid:146)s [598] study provides evidence that many (cid:133)rms in this industry\n",
			"do a substantial portion of their business with just a few, and in many cases just one,\n",
			"partner; and also provides some insight into the potential di\u2044erences between a network\n",
			"of close relationships versus a more distant market-style relationships.\n",
			"\n",
			"Another example of a partly-networked market is that of the Marseille (cid:133)sh market\n",
			"as analyzed by Kirman [378] and Weisbuch, Kirman, and Herreiner [626]. The (cid:133)sh\n",
			"market has several critical features. First, the (cid:133)sh are perishable. This means that the\n",
			"ability for buyers and sellers to smooth inventory is quite limited, as the (cid:147)fresh(cid:148) (cid:133)sh\n",
			"need to be consumed soon after they are caught.4 Second, the supply of (cid:133)sh is variable\n",
			"\n",
			"4This is changing over time, as methods of freezing and transporting (cid:133)sh are advancing. (cid:147)Fresh(cid:148)\n",
			"is in quotes, as in fact some types of (cid:133)sh that are considered fresh are frozen on board the boats on\n",
			"which they are caught. Nevertheless, there is a demand for local (cid:133)sh in the Marseille market (e.g., as\n",
			"ingredients in Marseille(cid:146)s famous bouillabaisse).\n",
			"\n",
			"\f428\n",
			"\n",
			"CHAPTER 10. NETWORKED MARKETS\n",
			"\n",
			"as the catch is random and a\u2044ected by various conditions including weather, water\n",
			"conditions, and (cid:133)sh populations. Third, the buyers of the (cid:133)sh di\u2044er in their demand\n",
			"elasticities for the (cid:133)sh; that is, they di\u2044er in the importance of (cid:133)sh for them and\n",
			"how their willingness to pay varies with quantity. A famous restaurant that has built\n",
			"a reputation on serving Marseille(cid:146)s (cid:133)nest bouillabaisse has to be able to consistently\n",
			"buy (cid:133)sh of a reliable quantity. Another local restaurant that does not specialize in\n",
			"bouillabaisse can adjust its menu and ingredients as availability changes.\n",
			"\n",
			"Weisbuch, Kirman, and Herreiner [626] examine the market between 1988 and 1991\n",
			"considering buyers and sellers in the market for more than 8 months. There are 45\n",
			"sellers and over 1400 buyers, and a wide range of (cid:133)sh. The buyers are restaurants\n",
			"and retailers and there are no posted prices so that each price transaction is decided\n",
			"bilaterally between the buyer and seller. In terms of a network structure, they (cid:133)nd\n",
			"that a sizeable fraction of buyers are loyal to a single seller, while other buyers buy\n",
			"from many sellers. For example, with regards to cod, almost half (48 percent) of the\n",
			"buyers purchase more than 95 percent of their cod from just one seller. With regards\n",
			"to whiting and sole, more than half of the buyers buy more than 80 percent of their\n",
			"(cid:133)sh from just one seller. They break this down by the patterns of buyers and note that\n",
			"buyers purchasing large quantities are signi(cid:133)cantly more likely to be loyal than other\n",
			"buyers. For example, dividing buyers into those who bought more than two tons per\n",
			"month and those who bought less, the ones who bought more transact on average 85\n",
			"percent of the time with their most visited seller while this drops to 56 percent of the\n",
			"time for those who buy less. This suggests that one sees some established relationships,\n",
			"as well as some shopping around. Weisbuch, Kirman, and Herreiner [626] examine a\n",
			"simple model of this, where the driving force is predictability of available (cid:133)sh and of\n",
			"demand for (cid:133)sh. The model builds on what one might think of as a complicated version\n",
			"of musical chairs: buyers must choose to go to just one seller each day and the seller is\n",
			"either able to meet the buyer(cid:146)s demand. Buyers follow an adaptive updating rule, with\n",
			"a higher tendency to visit sellers who have met their demands in the past. This is a sort\n",
			"of metaphor that captures the idea that as a buyer shops around during the day, time\n",
			"is lost and fewer (cid:133)sh are available. On a day where there is a relatively large catch this\n",
			"might result in a better price, but on a day where there is a relatively small catch this\n",
			"might result in a relatively high price or being closed out of the market. Thus, there are\n",
			"some frictions in this type of market so that it does not simply clear as a classic supply\n",
			"and demand model all at once, but requires some search by buyers, and price-setting\n",
			"by individual and only partly-informed sellers. Buyers face some coordination issues\n",
			"\n",

			"\n",
			"429\n",
			"\n",
			"and also learn about the available supply of di\u2044erent sellers over time. Having a larger\n",
			"demand, among other things, tilts a buyer towards settling down with just one (large)\n",
			"seller, partly due to the predictability of the supply.\n",
			"\n",
			"10.1.3 Which Markets Should be Networked?\n",
			"\n",
			"These examples point to some of the issues that underly why speci(cid:133)c relationships\n",
			"might emerge in the trade of goods and services. The garment industry analysis high-\n",
			"lights (cid:147)trust(cid:148) as a central part of the importance of repeated relationships. The (cid:133)sh\n",
			"market analysis highlights predictability as a central part of the importance of re-\n",
			"peated relationships. There are a variety of situations that lead to some advantages of\n",
			"a repeated or close relationship, basically having to do with di\u00a2 culties in contracting.\n",
			"This is related to some of the theory developed by Williamson [629] explaining the\n",
			"organization of (cid:133)rms. Williamson examines a variety of di\u2044erent frictions that can\n",
			"make it di\u00a2 cult for two parties to completely contract upon the exchange of goods or\n",
			"services. Williamson then argues that if a single organization or (cid:133)rm is on both sides\n",
			"of the transaction, then it can internalize the di\u00a2 culty and overcome the obstacle to\n",
			"contracting. Granovetter [292] critiques Williamson(cid:146)s argument pointing out that it is\n",
			"not so clear that placing things within a (cid:133)rm provides a solution that could not be han-\n",
			"dled through some sort of other relationship. For example, reputations and repeated\n",
			"interactions can help discipline transactions and this could take place within the fabric\n",
			"of a network instead of being internal to a (cid:133)rm. Also, contracting parties being within\n",
			"the same (cid:133)rm does not imply that their incentives are aligned.\n",
			"\n",
			"Drawing from the above examples and studies of incomplete contracting, let us ex-\n",
			"amine some of the features of given transactions that might favor placing them within\n",
			"the context of a network of transactions where reputations and/or repeated relation-\n",
			"ships are relied upon to help circumvent di\u00a2 culties inherent in a given transaction.\n",
			"\n",
			"In many situations, there are unforeseen contingencies that arise between two par-\n",
			"ties involved in a contractual relationship. It may be that some speci(cid:133)c input is not\n",
			"available, or a new regulation appears that requires the redesign of a product and some\n",
			"delay, and so forth. One can try to write a contract that completely covers all possible\n",
			"contingencies, but complex transactions (for instance, the construction of a building)\n",
			"this might not be possible. If the relationships between the parties are repeated, so that\n",
			"they deal with each other on an ongoing basis then these problems are not viewed as\n",
			"a one-time expense on one of the two parties(cid:146)side, but instead can be evened out over\n",
			"time. This can make the bargaining over such unforseen issues smoother, as suggested\n",
			"\n",
			"\f430\n",
			"\n",
			"CHAPTER 10. NETWORKED MARKETS\n",
			"\n",
			"by some of Uzzi(cid:146)s [598] interviews.\n",
			"\n",
			"Contractual incompleteness can arise not only because of unforeseen contingencies,\n",
			"but also because of speci(cid:133)c investments that might need to be made for particular\n",
			"transactions and require long-term use to realize their full value. Contractual incom-\n",
			"pleteness can also arise because of asymmetries in information. Asymmetries in infor-\n",
			"mation manifest themselves in the form of moral hazard problems, where one party to\n",
			"a contract cannot fully observe the actions of the other, and adverse selection problems\n",
			"where one party does not fully observe some attributes of the good being traded. Once\n",
			"again, long-term relationships can help resolve these issues. For example, in terms\n",
			"of moral hazard problems, having a repeated interaction allows one party to examine\n",
			"long run performance of the other. If a customer takes a car to a local mechanic on a\n",
			"regular basis, and the mechanic frequently claims that the car requires extensive and\n",
			"expensive repairs, the customer can look for a new mechanic. The fact that current\n",
			"performance can in(cid:135)uence future business helps temper the moral hazard problem. In\n",
			"contrast, if a car needs a repair far from home, and it is a one time interaction, the\n",
			"incentives for the mechanic to suggest a more expensive repair than is necessary can\n",
			"be substantially larger. Similar reasoning favors long term relationships in the face of\n",
			"adverse selection. If a (cid:133)rm buys parts whose reliability or longevity cannot be observed\n",
			"except with the passage of time, then having repeated transactions can help provide\n",
			"incentives for the supplier to deliver a speci(cid:133)ed quality of parts.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are tradeo\u2044s to maintaining such closed relationships, as it limits one(cid:146)s abil-\n",
			"ity to shop around for alternative prices. It might be that a given (cid:133)rm wants to work\n",
			"with two or three suppliers of the same parts over time. One can also rely on the\n",
			"transmission of information through a network to help temper asymmetric informa-\n",
			"tion problems. Maintaining a (cid:147)reputation(cid:148)for providing high-quality parts or service\n",
			"can help provide incentives that overcome some of the di\u00a2 culties arising from asym-\n",
			"metries in information, if word of mouth can spread information about outcomes to\n",
			"other potential future business partners. Thus, we might see more complex network\n",
			"relationships for various reasons.\n",
			"\n",
			"Beyond these asymmetric information considerations, we also saw the issues of\n",
			"predictability and more basic uncertainty as potential explanations for the relationships\n",

			"putting di\u2044erent buyers and sellers in touch with each other. Labor markets serve as\n",
			"an excellent example. A (cid:133)rm wanting to hire a new employee might ask its existing\n",
			"employees for referrals. This could happen for a variety of reasons.6 A very basic reason\n",
			"is simply that it wants to hire people similar to the employees that it already has.\n",
			"Given the homophily in many social networks, a (cid:133)rm can take advantage of its existing\n",
			"workforce in order to (cid:133)nd other people with similar characteristics. For example, if a\n",
			"fast-food restaurant wants to hire someone willing to work part-time on weeknights and\n",
			"for minimum wage with low bene(cid:133)ts, it might ask its employees if they know of anyone\n",
			"else who would be available in similar circumstances. This can save the time and\n",
			"cost of advertising and then sifting through applications. Beyond this, using current\n",
			"employees might reach potential hires that might not be reached via the advertising. It\n",
			"can also be that current employees are good at communicating with potential employees\n",
			"regarding whether a potential job is a good match.\n",
			"In addition to the bene(cid:133)ts of\n",
			"locating potential hires who (cid:133)t well with the (cid:133)rm, current employees might be credible\n",

			"di\u2044erent aspects of networked labor markets.\n",
			"\n",
			"10.2.1 Strong and Weak Ties\n",
			"\n",
			"As discussed in Section 3.2.7, the role of social networks in (cid:133)nding jobs was central to\n",
			"Granovetter(cid:146)s [289], [290] in(cid:135)uential research that distinguished between (cid:147)strong(cid:148)and\n",
			"(cid:145)weak(cid:148)social ties. To recall those data, Granovetter measured the strength of a tie by\n",
			"the number of times that individuals had interacted in a past year (strong = at least\n",
			"twice a week, medium = less than twice a week but more than once a year, and weak =\n",
			"once a year or less). Of the 54 people whom he interviewed who had found their most\n",
			"recent job through a social contact, he found that 16.7 percent had found their jobs\n",
			"through a strong tie, 55.7 percent through a medium tie, and 27.6 percent through a\n",
			"weak tie.7\n",
			"\n",
			"Building on a distinction between strong and weak ties, Boorman [85] modeled indi-\n",
			"viduals(cid:146)decisions of how to allocate their time between maintaining these two di\u2044erent\n",
			"forms of ties in one of the (cid:133)rst (cid:147)economic(cid:148)models of social networks. Boorman(cid:146)s model\n",
			"is based on the following structure. An individual has to divide his or her time between\n",
			"maintaining strong and weak ties. Strong ties take more time, and so the individual is\n",
			"faced with a tradeo\u2044 having more ties, but weak ones, or fewer ties, but strong ones.\n",
			"Boorman represents this by requiring that an individual have T units of time spent\n",
			"maintaining relationships. If W is the number of weak ties that an individual has, and\n",
			"S is the number of strong ties, then they must satisfy:\n",
			"\n",
			"W + (cid:21)S = T\n",
			"\n",
			"(10.1)\n",
			"\n",
			"where (cid:21) > 1 is a factor indicating how much more time must be spent to maintain a\n",
			"strong tie.\n",
			"\n",
			"Boorman(cid:146)s ties also lead to di\u2044erent bene(cid:133)ts. Strong ties have priority in obtaining\n",
			"job information from social contacts. This operates as follows. Time ticks by in discrete\n",
			"periods. In any period, with probability (cid:22) an individual has need of a job. This is\n",
			"\n",
			"7There is also a series of studies that have examined how strong and weak ties a\u2044ect labor outcomes,\n",
			"and some debate about the relative e\u2044ectiveness of weak ties. For example, see Lin, Ensel and Vaughn\n",
			"[412] and Bridges and Villemez [98] and the literature that follows.\n",

			"\n",
			"the same across individuals and independent of history and the state of the system in\n",
			"the previous period. E\u2044ectively, the system restarts in each period. If an individual\n",
			"needs a job then he or she can (cid:133)nd a job in two ways. First, the individual can hear\n",
			"about a job directly, which again happens at some exogenous rate (cid:14), independent of the\n",
			"state of the system. In that case, the individual takes the job. Second, the individual\n",
			"might not hear directly, but instead might have a friend who is employed who happens\n",
			"to randomly hear about a job.\n",
			"In that case, the employed friend looks around at\n",
			"his or her strong ties and weak ties. If some of the strong ties are unemployed, then\n",
			"the employed friend passes the job to one of them uniformly at random. If all of the\n",
			"strong ties are employed, then the employed friend passes the job on to one of the weak\n",
			"ties uniformly at random. Thus, strong ties have a priority in hearing about a job.\n",
			"Boorman examines networks that are trees with in(cid:133)nite numbers of nodes so that one\n",
			"does not have to worry about the issue of two neighbors being neighbors of each other.\n",
			"He also considers situations where all individuals choose the same allocation of ties, so\n",
			"that the network is regular in a strong sense. Let qs (cid:20) qw be the probability that one\n",
			"does not hear about a job through a given strong tie and weak tie respectively, when\n",
			"in need. The chance of getting a job when in need can then be written as\n",
			"\n",

			"\n",
			"s qW\n",
			"\n",
			"w(cid:1) :\n",
			"\n",
			"A given agent thus trades o\u2044 the higher probability that strong ties lead to job\n",
			"information against being able to maintain fewer of them. One can derive the expres-\n",
			"sions for qs and qw as a function of the parameters of the model. For instance, qs\n",
			"will depend on the probability that a given strong friend will be employed and how\n",
			"many other strong ties might be competing for job information at a given time. With\n",
			"expressions for qs and qw in hand, one can then look for an equilibrium of the system\n",
			"where individuals are optimally choosing S; W given the anticipated qs and qw, and the\n",
			"anticipated qs and qw correspond to the ones generated by the choices that individuals\n",
			"have made concerning S; W . This is hard to solve for directly, and can involve multiple\n",
			"equilibria, but one can at least work out simulations for some parameter values, as\n",
			"Boorman does.\n",
			"\n",
			"There are several intuitive e\u2044ects that Boorman reports from simulations. First, as\n",
			"(cid:21) increases, the relative cost of strong versus weak ties goes up and so the equilibrium\n",
			"involves fewer strong and more weak ties. Second, as (cid:22) decreases, so that one is\n",
			"less likely to need a job, the relative value of weak ties goes up. One only gets job\n",
			"information via a weak tie when all of the weak acquaintance(cid:146)s strong neighbors are\n",
			"employed, which is more likely when (cid:22) is low.\n",

			"The Boorman model makes important strides in terms of considering strong and\n",
			"weak ties to be choice variables, and in terms of deriving tradeo\u2044s between di\u2044erent\n",
			"forms of ties. However, the model lacks a number of things that we might be interested\n",
			"in. As a model of strong and weak ties, it is missing one of the critical ingredients\n",
			"that was the basis for Granovetter(cid:146)s theory: the idea that weak ties were more likely\n",
			"to bridge to parts of a network that are not accessed more directly whereas strong\n",
			"ties are more likely to link to nodes that are already at a short path distance. Such\n",
			"aspects of network architecture are missing from Boorman(cid:146)s model. Also, the model is\n",
			"missing the correlation in employment and time series implications that we might be\n",
			"interested in from the perspective of explaining how labor markets work. The fact that\n",
			"the state of the network is history independent simpli(cid:133)es the model (with the need for\n",
			"jobs being independent of history and the previous state of the network), but then we\n",
			"miss interesting dynamics and patterns of employment as a function of social structure.\n",
			"\n",
			"10.2.2 A Networked Model of Employment\n",
			"\n",
			"Calv(cid:243)-Armengol and Jackson [119], [120] examine a model that is similar to Boorman(cid:146)s\n",
			"in having job information arrive directly and through neighbors, but that brings net-\n",
			"work structure to the forefront to see how network structure can impact employment\n",
			"and wage dynamics and distribution across a society.8 Before getting into the model\n",
			"in detail, let me start with a brief overview of it. In the simplest version of the model,\n",
			"workers are connected by an undirected network. Randomly, an employed worker can\n",
			"lose his or her job.\n",
			"Information\n",
			"about new job openings arrives randomly to the workers in the network. A worker can\n",
			"hear about a job directly. If the worker is unemployed, then he or she takes the job.\n",
			"Similarly to the Boorman model, if the worker is employed, then the worker randomly\n",
			"picks an unemployed neighbor to receive the information; but in this case treating all\n",
			"unemployed neighbors with equal weight. The system operates over time, so that the\n",
			"starting state at the beginning of one period is state the system ended in the last period,\n",
			"and so dynamic patterns can be studied. The network becomes important in several\n",
			"ways. Having more neighbors gives a worker potential access to more job information\n",
			"\n",
			"If that happens, then the worker looks for work.\n",
			"\n",
			"8Such information arrival processes are also in Diamond [188], without networks. Calv(cid:243)-Armengol\n",
			"[115] developed a networked variation of Diamond(cid:146)s and Boorman(cid:146)s models of information passing to\n",
			"study incentives for network formation. Calv(cid:243)-Armengol and Jackson [119], [120]developed a richer\n",
			"model in bringing in wages and variations on job information passing and used it to study employment\n",
			"and wage patterns and dynamics.\n",
			"\n",
			"\f10.2. NETWORKS IN LABOR MARKETS\n",
			"\n",
			"435\n",
			"\n",
			"and so a higher average employment rate and higher average wages (in the version of\n",
			"the model with wages). This also leads to correlation in neighbors(cid:146)employment status.\n",
			"An unemployed worker who has an employed neighbor is more likely to hear about a\n",
			"job opening than a similar worker with an unemployed neighbor, leading to a higher\n",
			"probability that a worker becomes employed in any given period as a function of how\n",
			"many of his or her neighbors are employed. This leads to a positive correlation in\n",
			"employment.\n",
			"\n",
			"Beyond this basic structure, there are a number of things that can be analyzed.\n",
			"The model described above leads to a Markov chain, so that one can keep track of\n",
			"what tomorrow(cid:146)s employment pattern is likely to look like given today(cid:146)s employment\n",
			"pattern. From this, one can deduce long run steady-state distributions of employment\n",
			"and how these vary with network structure. In addition to things like the correlation\n",
			"structure, one can also examine the time series of employment. For instance, a prevalent\n",
			"observation in the labor economics literature is what is known as duration dependence.\n",
			"That refers to the fact that workers who have been unemployed for more periods are less\n",
			"likely to (cid:133)nd work in a given period than workers who are just recently unemployed.\n",
			"There are various partial explanations for this, but the network model exhibits this\n",
			"quite naturally. Conditional on a worker being unemployed for a longer time, it is\n",
			"likely that many of the worker(cid:146)s neighbors are also unemployed, and hence have not\n",
			"been passing information along. This means that it is less likely that such a worker will\n",
			"be hearing about a job in the next period, compared to a worker whose neighborhood\n",
			"has a higher employment level. One can also enrich the model to allow for di\u2044erent\n",
			"types of jobs, di\u2044erent wage levels, and decisions such as whether or not to pursue\n",
			"education.\n",
			"\n",
			"The Model Description\n",
			"\n",
			"I present the simplest version of the model. For variations with heterogeneous jobs and\n",
			"multiple wage levels, see Calv(cid:243)-Armengol and Jackson [120]. In the version presented\n",
			"here, all jobs are identical and there is just one wage level, which simpli(cid:133)es the analysis.\n",
			"There are n workers or agents who are connected by an undirected network, repre-\n",

			"Period t begins with some agents employed and others unemployed, as described by\n",

			"di\u2044erence in the probability of becoming employed after one week of unemployment\n",
			"compared to one year above) even after including a wide variety of characteristics, has\n",
			"been a puzzle. As pointed out by Calv(cid:243)-Armengol and Jackson [119], such a networked\n",

			"illustrate this e\u2044ect with some examples.\n",
			"\n",
			"While the networks in Figure 10.2.3 are small, they show that understanding a\n",
			"worker(cid:146)s social context can account for some of the observed duration dependence. The\n",
			"idea behind a networked labor market exhibiting duration dependence is as follows.\n",
			"The longer that a worker has been unemployed, the greater the probability of the\n",
			"worker(cid:146)s neighbors being unemployed. This re(cid:135)ects both that the worker has not been\n",
			"able to pass the neighbors any job information, and also that the worker has not\n",
			"heard about a job from the neighbors and so it is less likely that the neighbors are\n",
			"employed. As more of a worker(cid:146)s neighbors are unemployed, it becomes less likely that\n",
			"the worker will hear about a job in the coming period. For instance, if a worker has\n",
			"been unemployed for only a week, it is still quite possible that many of the worker(cid:146)s\n",
			"neighbors are employed and so the worker will hear about a job shortly. However, if a\n",
			"worker has been unemployed for a year, then that suggests that many of the worker(cid:146)s\n",
			"neighbors are also unemployed, and makes it unlikely that the worker will will hear\n",

			"second-period worker could have other ties to (cid:133)rst-period workers and thus could be\n",

			"\n",
			"Each seller has a single object to sell which has no value to the seller. Buyers have\n",

			"\n",
			"Corominas-Bosch models the bargaining process explicitly via an alternating move\n",

			"individual has several links then there are several possible trading patterns. Thus,\n",
			"the network structure essentially determines bargaining power of various buyers and\n",
			"sellers.\n",
			"\n",
			"The game that Corominas-Bosch examines to predict the prices and transactions is\n",
			"\n",
			"\f10.3. MODELS OF NETWORKED MARKETS\n",
			"\n",
			"461\n",
			"\n",
			"described as follows. In the (cid:133)rst period sellers simultaneously call out prices. A buyer\n",
			"can only select from the prices that she has heard called out by the sellers to whom\n",
			"she is linked. Buyers simultaneously respond by either choosing to accept some single\n",
			"price o\u2044er they received, or to reject all price o\u2044ers they received. If there are several\n",
			"sellers who have called out the same price and/or several buyers who have accepted\n",
			"the same price, and there is any discretion under the given network connections as\n",
			"to which trades should occur, then there is a careful protocol for determining which\n",
			"trades occur (which is designed to maximize the number of eventual transactions). At\n",
			"the end of the period, trades are made and buyers and sellers who have traded are\n",
			"cleared from the market. In the next period the situation reverses and buyers call out\n",
			"prices. These are then either accepted or rejected by the sellers connected to them in\n",
			"the same way as described above. Each period the roles of proposer and responder\n",
			"switch, and this process repeats itself inde(cid:133)nitely until all remaining buyers and sellers\n",
			"are not linked to each other. Buyers and sellers are impatient and discount according\n",
			"to a common discount factor 0 < (cid:14) < 1. So a transaction at price p in period t is worth\n",
			"(cid:14)tp to a seller and (cid:14)t(1 (cid:0) p) to a buyer.\n",
			"\n",
			"In an equilibrium with very patient agents (so that (cid:14) is close to 1), there are\n",
			"e\u2044ectively three possible outcomes for any given agent: either he or she gets most of\n",
			"of the available gains from trade, or roughly half of the gains from trade, or a small\n",
			"portion of the available gains from trade. Which of these three cases ensues depends\n",
			"on that agent(cid:146)s position in the network. Some easy special cases are as follows. First,\n",
			"consider a seller linked to two buyers, who are only linked to that seller. Competition\n",
			"between the buyers to accept the price will lead to an equilibrium price of close to 1\n",
			"if agents are su\u00a2 ciently patient. So the payo\u2044 to the seller in such a network will be\n",
			"close to 1, while the payo\u2044 to the buyers will be close 0. This is reversed for a single\n",
			"buyer linked to two sellers.\n",
			"\n",
			"More generally, which side of the market outnumbers the other is a bit tricky\n",
			"to determine as it depends on the overall link structure, which can be much more\n",

			"\n",
			"The limiting payo\u2044s found by this algorithm are illustrated in Figure 10.3.2 .\n",

			"and removed at an earlier step). In this case, it is sort of a game of (cid:147)musical chairs(cid:148)\n",
			"among the sellers. At most two can sell an object, and so sellers who are quoting the\n",

			"\n",
			"In this model the potential value of a transaction is random, depending on the\n",
